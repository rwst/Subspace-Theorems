# Arithmetic heights and Siegel's lemma: target signatures

**This file is not the roadmap and is not exhaustive.** The definitive document is the
roadmap, `ArithmeticHeights/README.md`, which every `README.md` below refers to.
The statements here suggest Lean forms for the milestones whose names and shapes are most likely
to drift, so that contributors and reviewers converge on them; discharging all of them finishes
neither a layer nor the roadmap.

Everything below is stated against Mathlib's `Mathlib/NumberTheory/Height/` (M. Stoll): the
`Height.AdmissibleAbsValues` class, `Height.mulHeight₁`, `Height.mulHeight`,
`Projectivization.mulHeight`, `NumberField.absMulHeight₁`, and the `Northcott` typeclass. None of
that is restated here; this roadmap consumes it. The declarations elaborate against the pinned
Mathlib and are stated with `sorry` (allowed in this human-owned roadmap library); what lands in
`TauCeti/` must be proved.

Names here are unqualified inside `TauCetiRoadmap.ArithmeticHeights` so that the prototype does not
occupy Mathlib's root namespaces. In `TauCeti/` they take the names `README.md` pins:
`polyMulHeight` is `Polynomial.mulHeight`, `matrixMulHeight` is `Matrix.mulHeight`,
`subspaceMulHeight` is `Submodule.mulHeight`, `pluckerPoint` is `Submodule.pluckerPoint`, and the
`absMulHeight`/`arakelovMulHeight` families sit in `NumberField`.

Every height below is Mathlib's **relative** height over the fixed field unless it carries the
`abs` prefix. A constant transcribed from the literature is an absolute-height constant; in the
relative height it is raised to `Height.totalWeight K`, exactly as Mathlib's `mulHeight₁_sum_le`
carries `#s ^ totalWeight K`.

The Layer 0.3 signatures below are those of
[mathlib4#41606](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/41606) and deliberately
carry its names, so that adopting Mathlib's version is a deletion plus an import. Likewise Layer
6.5 follows [mathlib4#40791](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/40791).

section Arakelov

variable {K : Type*} [Field K] [NumberField K] {ι : Type*} [Fintype ι]

/-- **Layer 0.1.** The Arakelov height: the ℓ² norm at the archimedean places, weighted by
`InfinitePlace.mult`, and the sup norm at the finite places. This is the normalization in which
the Bombieri–Vaaler constants of Layers 5.3 and 5.4 are stated; `Height.mulHeight` uses the sup
norm everywhere. Both live in the library and every bound says which one it is in.

The zero tuple takes the junk value `1`, as for `Height.mulHeight`: the displayed product is `0`
there, which would falsify `1 ≤ arakelovMulHeight` and both comparisons of Layer 0.2 below, which
are stated without a `x ≠ 0` hypothesis. `arakelovMulHeight_eq` recovers the displayed formula. -/

/-- **Layer 0.1.** The logarithmic Arakelov height. As everywhere in this development, the
logarithmic height is *defined* as the logarithm of the multiplicative one and never
independently. -/
def arakelovLogHeight (x : ι → K) : ℝ := log (arakelovMulHeight x)

/-- **Layer 0.1.** The one-variable (affine) case: the Arakelov height of the point `(x : 1)` of
the projective line. Its archimedean local factor is `((v x) ^ 2 + 1) ^ (v.mult / 2)`, so — unlike
in the sup-norm normalization — this is **not** `Height.mulHeight₁ x`. -/

/-- **Layer 0.1.** Its logarithm. -/
def arakelovLogHeight₁ (x : K) : ℝ := log (arakelovMulHeight₁ x)

/-- **Layer 0.1.** The Arakelov height is invariant under scaling, by the product formula, so it
descends to projective space exactly as `Height.mulHeight` does. -/

  sorry

/-- **Layer 0.2, upper comparison — the lemma that transports the literature's constants into
Mathlib's normalization.** The exponent is `totalWeight K = finrank ℚ K`, the sum of the local
degrees at the archimedean places. `ι` must be nonempty: on the empty index type both heights
take the junk value `1` while the right-hand side is `0`. -/

  sorry

/-- **Layer 0.2.** On a subsingleton index type the two normalizations agree — both are `1`, by
the product formula. ⚠ This is *not* `arakelovMulHeight₁ = mulHeight₁`, which is false: already
`arakelovMulHeight₁ (1 : K) = 2 ^ (Height.totalWeight K / 2 : ℝ)` while `mulHeight₁ (1 : K) = 1`.
The one-variable heights are related only by the two comparisons above, applied to `![x, 1]`. -/

section Absolute

/-- **Layer 0.4.** The absolute multiplicative height of a tuple of algebraic numbers: the
relative height computed over the field generated by the coordinates, normalized by the inverse of
its degree. This is the tuple analogue of Mathlib's `NumberField.absMulHeight₁`, which handles the
one-variable case through `ℚ⟮x⟯`; the junk value `1` off the algebraic numbers is inherited. -/

def absLogHeight {K : Type*} [Field K] [CharZero K] {ι : Type*} [Fintype ι] (x : ι → K) : ℝ :=
  log (absMulHeight x)

/-- **Layer 0.4 — field-extension invariance, the statement the layer exists for.** Over *any*
number field containing the coordinates, the absolute height is the relative height taken to the
power `1 / [K : ℚ]`. With `mulHeight_pow_finrank`, this says the absolute height does not depend on
the field of definition. Mathlib's `NumberField.absMulHeight₁_eq` is the one-variable case
(mathlib4#41606). -/
theorem absMulHeight_eq {K : Type*} [Field K] [NumberField K] {ι : Type*} [Fintype ι] (x : ι → K) :
    absMulHeight x = Height.mulHeight x ^ ((Module.finrank ℚ K : ℝ))⁻¹ :=

/-- **Layer 0.4.** The absolute height of a tuple restricts to Mathlib's absolute height of an
element, so the two agree where both are defined. -/

    absMulHeight ![x, 1] = NumberField.absMulHeight₁ x :=
  sorry

/-- **Layer 0.4 — scaling invariance, for algebraic scalars.** The algebraicity hypothesis is not
decorative: for `c` transcendental and `x` a nonzero algebraic tuple, `c • x` has a transcendental
coordinate and `absMulHeight (c • x)` is the junk value `1`. Consequently the descent to
`Projectivization K (ι → K)` holds only over a field all of whose elements are algebraic,
`[Algebra.IsAlgebraic ℚ K]` (a number field, or `AlgebraicClosure ℚ`), and is stated there. -/

/-! ## Layer 1: Northcott, Kronecker, and the Mahler-measure bridge -/

section Northcott

variable {K : Type*} [Field K] [NumberField K]

/-- **Layer 1.1.** The Northcott property on projective space, which
`Mathlib/NumberTheory/Height/Northcott.lean` records as its own TODO. The instance for
`Projectivization.logHeight` then follows from Mathlib's `Northcott.comp_of_bddAbove`, exactly as
it does for `logHeight₁`. ⚠ There is no such instance for `Height.mulHeight` on `ι → K` itself:
`mulHeight_smul_eq_mulHeight` puts the whole line `Kˣ • x` at one height, so
`{x | mulHeight x ≤ B}` is infinite for every `B ≥ 1`. Northcott is a property of the projective
height only. -/
instance instNorthcottProjectivizationMulHeight {ι : Type*} [Finite ι] :
    Northcott (Projectivization.mulHeight (K := K) (ι := ι)) :=
  sorry

/-- **Layer 1.2 — the bridge to Mathlib's Mahler measure.** For an algebraic number `x` with
primitive integer minimal polynomial `f`, the absolute height is the `deg f`-th root of the Mahler
measure of `f`. Stated as an equality of `deg`-th powers so that no real exponentiation appears.
The polynomial is pinned as the primitive `f : ℤ[X]` that is a nonzero rational multiple of
`minpoly ℚ x`; that determines `f` up to sign, and the Mahler measure ignores the sign (for
`x = 1/2`, `f = 2 X - 1`). The hypotheses force `x` algebraic, since `minpoly ℚ x = 0` otherwise
and `0` is not primitive. ⚠ It is **not** `minpoly ℤ x`, which Mathlib defines as `0` off the
algebraic integers, so a statement through `minpoly ℤ x` covers only integral `x` and cannot feed
Northcott's theorem 1.3. This identity is what makes Northcott's theorem and Kronecker's theorem
cheap. -/
theorem absMulHeight₁_pow_natDegree {x : ℂ} {f : Polynomial ℤ} (hf : f.IsPrimitive) {c : ℚ}
    (hc : c ≠ 0) (hfx : f.map (Int.castRingHom ℚ) = Polynomial.C c * minpoly ℚ x) :
    NumberField.absMulHeight₁ x ^ f.natDegree = (f.map (Int.castRingHom ℂ)).mahlerMeasure :=
  sorry

/-- **Layer 1.3 — Northcott's theorem, in the form with varying degree.** Mathlib's
`NumberField.finite_setOfPred_mulHeight₁_le` fixes the field; this is the statement that the
literature calls Northcott's theorem, and it is what the elliptic-curve and Diophantine
applications need. -/
theorem finite_setOf_absMulHeight₁_le_of_finrank_le (B : ℝ) (D : ℕ) :
    {x : ℂ | IsIntegral ℚ x ∧ NumberField.absMulHeight₁ x ≤ B ∧
      Module.finrank ℚ ℚ⟮x⟯ ≤ D}.Finite :=
  sorry

/-- **Layer 1.4 — Kronecker's theorem.** An algebraic number has absolute height one exactly when
it is zero or a root of unity. The algebraicity hypothesis is not decorative: `absMulHeight₁` takes
the junk value `1` on every transcendental, so the statement without it is false. -/
theorem absMulHeight₁_eq_one_iff {x : ℂ} (hx : IsIntegral ℚ x) :
    NumberField.absMulHeight₁ x = 1 ↔ x = 0 ∨ ∃ n, 0 < n ∧ x ^ n = 1 :=

each degree bound there is a uniform positive gap. -/

section Polynomials

variable {K : Type*} [Field K] [Height.AdmissibleAbsValues K]

/-- **Layer 2.1.** The height of a univariate polynomial is the height of its coefficient
`Finsupp`. `Polynomial` is a wrapper around `ℕ →₀ K`, so Mathlib's `Finsupp.mulHeight` *is* the
definition and no new construction is made. -/

/-- **Layer 2.1.** The logarithmic height of a polynomial. -/
def polyLogHeight (p : Polynomial K) : ℝ := log (polyMulHeight p)

/-- **Layer 2.1.** A constant polynomial has height `1`: its coefficient tuple has one entry, and
a one-entry tuple has height `1` by the product formula (`mulHeight_eq_one_of_subsingleton`),
with the zero polynomial at the junk value. ⚠ Not `mulHeight₁ a`, which is the height of the
*two*-entry tuple `![a, 1]`. -/
theorem polyMulHeight_C (a : K) : polyMulHeight (Polynomial.C a) = 1 :=

`a` has the height of `a`. -/
theorem polyMulHeight_X_sub_C (a : K) :
    polyMulHeight (Polynomial.X - Polynomial.C a) = Height.mulHeight₁ a :=
  sorry

/-- **Layer 2.2 — Gauss's lemma for heights.** At a nonarchimedean place the local factor is
exactly multiplicative. This is the only place where the ultrametric inequality is used sharply,
and it is what makes the loss in Gelfond's inequality purely archimedean. -/

/-- **Layer 2.3 — Gelfond's inequality, upper half.** The literature's `2 ^ (deg p + deg q)` is
the absolute-height constant; the relative height picks it up once per archimedean place with
multiplicity, hence the exponent `totalWeight K`. -/

      2 ^ ((p.natDegree + q.natDegree) * Height.totalWeight K) *

/-- **Layer 2.3 — Gelfond's inequality, lower half.** Together with the upper half this bounds the
height of a factor, which is the direction transcendence arguments use. -/

section Matrices

variable {K : Type*} [Field K] [Height.AdmissibleAbsValues K] {m n : Type*} [Fintype m] [Fintype n]

/-- **Layer 2.5.** The height of a matrix is the height of the tuple of its **entries**. The height
of its row space — the height of the tuple of maximal minors, `H(A)` in Bombieri–Vaaler — is
`subspaceMulHeight (rowSpace A)` and is never called the height of `A`. The classical literature
uses one symbol for both; this library does not. -/
def matrixMulHeight (A : Matrix m n K) : ℝ := Height.mulHeight fun p : m × n ↦ A p.1 p.2

/-- **Layer 2.5.** The height of a matrix is invariant under transpose. -/

  sorry

/-- **Layer 2.5.** The product bound. The archimedean loss at one place is the inner dimension
`card n` (the triangle inequality on a sum of `card n` terms), so in the relative height it is
`card n ^ totalWeight K`; over `ℚ(i)`, `A = ![![1, 1]]` and `B = ![![N, 0], ![N, 1]]` show the
exponent is needed. `n` must be nonempty: for `n` empty, `A * B = 0` has the junk height `1`
against a right-hand side of `0`. -/

`Set.powersetCard.orderIsoOfFin` is the index identification, pinned here once and for all so that
no later statement has to re-choose it. Stated over a commutative ring so that the Cauchy–Binet

Proposition 2.8.8), in its ring-generic form: the determinant of `A Bᵀ` is the sum over the
`m`-element column sets of the products of the corresponding maximal minors. The two archimedean
specializations below are what Layer 5 consumes. -/

/-- **Layer 3.4 — Cauchy–Binet at a real place.** The ℓ² local factor of the minor vector is the
square root of the Gram determinant `det (A Aᵀ)`. This is exactly where the `√(det (A Aᵀ))` of the
Bombieri–Vaaler bound comes from, so it is a named milestone rather than a step inside a proof. -/

`(Pi.basisFun K ι).exteriorPower k` of `⋀[K]^k (ι → K)`, is a nonzero tuple indexed by
`Set.powersetCard ι k`; a change of basis multiplies it by a determinant, hence a unit, so the
induced point of projective space depends only on `V`. The `[LinearOrder ι]` is what
`Module.Basis.exteriorPower` needs to order each wedge of basis vectors; a different order changes
the coordinates by signs only, so the height of 3.2 does not depend on it. Build this the way

height of any matrix cutting it out. The route is that the complementation isomorphism
`⋀^k V ≅ ⋀^n V ⊗ ⋀^(n-k) V*` carries basis vectors to basis vectors up to sign, so the two

/-- **Layer 6.3 — Hadamard's bound.** The regulator is at most `(2 d) ^ r` times the product of
the absolute logarithmic heights of Mathlib's fundamental system (and of any `r` independent
units): the regulator is the determinant of the `r × r` matrix of `logEmbedding`s, each row has
ℓ¹ norm at most `∑ w, |mult w · log (w ε)| = 2 · logHeight₁ ε = 2 d · h(ε)`, and Hadamard's
inequality bounds a determinant by the product of the row norms. -/

/-- **Layer 6.3 — a fundamental system of small height exists** (Bugeaud–Győry 1996, Lemma 1,
the case `S = S_∞`). The converse of Hadamard's bound cannot hold for every fundamental system — a
unimodular change of basis makes the heights arbitrarily large at fixed regulator — but some
fundamental system, a reduced basis of the unit lattice, has `∏ h(ε i) ≤ c(r, d) · R` with the
explicit constant `c = (r!)² / (2 ^ (r − 1) d ^ r)`. Route, theirs: 4.2 for the ℓ¹ unit ball, of
volume `2 ^ r / r!`, on `unitLattice K`, of covolume `regulator K`, gives `∏ λ i ≤ r! · R`; the
basis of 4.6 costs `r! / 2 ^ (r − 1)`; and `h(ε) ≤ ‖logEmbedding ε‖₁ / d` by 6.1, which costs
`d ^ (-r)`. "Fundamental system" is what Mathlib's
`closure_fundSystem_sup_torsion_eq_top` says of `fundSystem`: `r` units generating the unit
group modulo torsion. -/

/-! ## Worked examples (acceptance criteria)

These are cheap checks that the definitions mean what they should; they belong in the `TauCeti/`
files as `example`s. See the "Worked examples" section of `README.md` for what each one rejects. -/

section Examples

/-- The rational height, from Mathlib's `Rat.mulHeight₁_eq_max`. A definition that does not give
`4` here has numerator and denominator confused. -/
example : Height.mulHeight₁ (3 / 4 : ℚ) = 4 := sorry

/-- The two normalizations genuinely differ, so the `√N` of 5.5 and the `H_Ar` on the right of
5.3 and 5.4 are not cosmetic: a proof that silently interchanges them is wrong. -/
example : arakelovMulHeight ![(1 : ℚ), 1] = Real.sqrt 2 := sorry

/-- …while the sup-norm height of the same tuple is `1`. -/
example : Height.mulHeight ![(1 : ℚ), 1] = 1 := sorry

/-- **Rejection test for Layer 1.4.** A transcendental has absolute height one by the junk value,
not by Kronecker, so a statement of Kronecker's theorem without an algebraicity hypothesis is
false. -/
example : NumberField.absMulHeight₁ (Real.pi : ℂ) = 1 := sorry

/-- **Rejection test for Layer 2.1.** A constant polynomial has height `1`, whatever the constant:
a statement `polyMulHeight (C a) = mulHeight₁ a` is refuted at `a = 2`. -/
example : polyMulHeight (Polynomial.C (2 : ℚ)) = 1 := sorry
