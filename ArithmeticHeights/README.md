# Roadmap: arithmetic heights and Siegel's lemma

A height measures the arithmetic complexity of an algebraic object, the way degree measures its
geometric complexity. Mathlib has the foundation: `Height.AdmissibleAbsValues`, the multiplicative
and logarithmic heights of a field element and of a tuple, the projective height, the instance for
number fields, and the Northcott property over a fixed number field. This roadmap builds the theory
that stands on that foundation and is missing everywhere in Lean: heights of **polynomials,
matrices, and linear subspaces**, the last through Schmidt's Plücker-coordinate height; the
**absolute** theory over `ℚ̄`, where Northcott's theorem and Kronecker's theorem live; and the two
theorems that heights of subspaces exist to state, **Siegel's lemma** and its invariant refinement
**Bombieri–Vaaler**.

"Done" means a contributor working on Diophantine approximation, transcendence, or Diophantine
geometry finds each object — the height of a number, of a polynomial, of a matrix, of a subspace —
at its natural generality with the full basic API, and finds Siegel's lemma as a consequence of a
developed theory rather than an isolated estimate. The subspace height is the hinge: it is what
makes Siegel's lemma invariant under row operations, it is what the duality theorem `H(V) = H(V^⊥)`
is about, and it is the object the Bombieri–Vaaler bound is stated in terms of.

Suggested home: `TauCeti/NumberTheory/Height/`, mirroring Mathlib's `Mathlib/NumberTheory/Height/`
(with `…/Height/Arakelov.lean`, `…/Northcott.lean`, `…/Polynomial.lean`, `…/Matrix.lean`,
`…/Plucker.lean`, `…/Subspace.lean`, `…/SiegelsLemma.lean`, `…/Units.lean`), and
`TauCeti/NumberTheory/GeometryOfNumbers/SuccessiveMinima.lean`, the directory the `EffectiveBounds`
roadmap created for its lattice-point lemmas; nothing here depends on those.

**Mathlib is developing the same foundation.** `Mathlib/NumberTheory/Height/` (M. Stoll) is the
active substrate this roadmap consumes, and two of its open pull requests cover ground named below:
[mathlib4#41606](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/41606) is Layer 0's
extension-invariance material, and
[mathlib4#40791](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/40791) is Layer 6's S-unit
theorem. Neither is a reason to wait or to leave a gap: build both here, named and shaped the way
those PRs do, so that adopting Mathlib's is a deletion plus an import. See *[Relationship to
Mathlib's height work](#relationship-to-mathlibs-height-work)*.

## Scope and boundaries

### Owned here

- The **Arakelov (ℓ²-at-infinity) height** beside Mathlib's sup-norm height, and the comparison
  between them, without which the constants in the literature cannot be stated.
- The **absolute height of a tuple** over `ℚ̄` and **invariance under field extension**.
- **Northcott's theorem** in its bounded-degree form, **Kronecker's theorem**, and the identity
  relating the absolute height to the Mahler measure of the minimal polynomial.
- Heights of **polynomials** (Gauss's lemma and Gelfond's inequality), of **linear forms**, and of
  **matrices**.
- The **Plücker point** of a subspace and **Schmidt's height of a subspace**, with the three theorems
  that make it an object rather than a definition: the **Cauchy–Binet identity** computing it as a
  determinant, the **duality theorem** `H(V) = H(V^⊥)`, and **submodularity** over the subspace
  lattice, with the product bounds on `H(V ⊓ W)` and `H(V ⊔ W)` it yields.
- **Successive minima**, **Minkowski's second theorem**, the two lemmas that turn their
  real-lattice output into number-field statements — the **extraction lemma** and **Vaaler's
  cube-slicing theorem** — and the **basis lemma** that turns the minima into a lattice basis,
  which the unit group consumes.
- **Siegel's lemma** in height form, over `ℤ` and over a number field, and the **Bombieri–Vaaler**
  refinement — the summit.
- The dictionary between heights and the **unit group**: units of height one, the regulator against
  the heights of a fundamental system, and the **S-unit theorem** for Mathlib's `S`-units.

### Consumed

- All of `Mathlib/NumberTheory/Height/` and `Mathlib/Order/Northcott.lean`. Every object below is
  defined in terms of Mathlib's `Height.mulHeight`, and none of it is restated.
- Mathlib's places, product formula, Dirichlet unit theorem and regulator, `S`-integers and
  `S`-units, Mahler measure, exterior powers, and geometry of numbers (`ZLattice`, covolume,
  Minkowski's convex-body theorem, the mixed embedding); itemised under *[What Mathlib already
  has](#what-mathlib-already-has-consume)*. Layer 4 is stated against Mathlib's lattice substrate
  directly and consumes nothing from any other roadmap.
- From the completed [`EffectiveBounds`](../../Completed/EffectiveBounds/README.md) roadmap, one
  thing only: the explicit discriminant bound from a basis of integers
  (`abs_discr_le_of_basis_isIntegral` under `TauCeti/NumberTheory/EffectiveBounds/`), which is
  how the `|D_{K/ℚ}|` in the constants of 5.3–5.4 is evaluated in the worked examples. Its
  `GeometryOfNumbers/` lemmas are a measure-free packing and doubling count upstream of `ZLattice`,
  and nothing in Layer 4 uses or extends them.

### Not owned here

- **Canonical and naïve heights on elliptic curves** — the naïve `x`-height, the approximate
  parallelogram law, the Néron–Tate height, its bilinear pairing and the elliptic regulator, and
  Mordell–Weil. These are Layer 6 of the [`EllipticCurves`](../EllipticCurves/README.md) roadmap,
  which consumes the general height API directly from Mathlib. Nothing here duplicates them, and
  Layer 1's Northcott material is stated so that roadmap can consume it.
- **Effective discriminant, class-number, and regulator bounds**, the explicit ideal count, and
  effective Hermite–Minkowski: the completed
  [`EffectiveBounds`](../../Completed/EffectiveBounds/README.md) roadmap. Its lattice-point
  packing and doubling lemmas are not inputs to Layer 4, whose milestones rest on Mathlib's
  `ZLattice` and `mixedEmbedding` alone.
- **Function-field heights** and the Riemann–Roch theory behind them:
  [`AlgebraicCurves`](../AlgebraicCurves/README.md). Mathlib's `Height.AdmissibleAbsValues` is
  general enough to carry them, and Layers 0–3 are written against that class wherever the proof
  does not need a number field, so the function-field instance costs nothing here; but supplying
  that instance and its divisor theory belongs there.
- **Dirichlet's unit theorem itself**, which Mathlib proves in full. Layer 6 consumes it.
- **Diophantine approximation proper** — Roth's theorem, the Schmidt subspace theorem, unit
  equations. See *[Long horizon](#long-horizon-a-roadmap-for-a-roadmap-not-work-to-attempt-here)*.

## Standing hypotheses

Work over a field `K` with `[Height.AdmissibleAbsValues K]` wherever the mathematics allows it, and
over a number field (`[NumberField K]`, degree `d = [K : ℚ]`, `r₁` real and `r₂` complex places,
discriminant `NumberField.discr K`) only where the proof genuinely needs one. Layers 0–3 are stated
at `AdmissibleAbsValues` generality except where an archimedean place, the degree, or the
discriminant appears; Layers 4 and 5 are number-field statements throughout, because Minkowski's
theorem is.

Tuples are indexed by an arbitrary `[Finite ι]` (`[Fintype ι]` where a cardinality appears in a
bound, and `[Nonempty ι]` wherever the empty tuple, whose height is the junk value `1`, would
falsify a bound whose right-hand side vanishes), following Mathlib's `Height.mulHeight (x : ι → K)`,
never by `Fin n` alone. Layer 3 additionally fixes a `[LinearOrder ι]`: `Module.Basis.exteriorPower`
needs it to order each wedge of basis vectors, and the height of 3.2 does not depend on the order
chosen, since a different order changes the Plücker coordinates by signs only. Subspaces are
`Submodule K (ι → K)` with a `Module.finrank` hypothesis, never `Module.Grassmannian`: Mathlib's
`Module.Grassmannian` is the *quotient* convention and records recovering the subspace convention as
its own TODO, so a roadmap that indexed subspace heights by it would be building on an object that
does not yet mean what we need. Reconcile with it if and when that TODO is discharged.

## Pinned conventions

Decide these once; an implementor who guesses differently produces a library that cannot be composed
with Mathlib's.

| Question | Convention |
| --- | --- |
| multiplicative or logarithmic | **Both**, for every owned object, with the multiplicative one primary and `logX := Real.log (mulX)` — exactly Mathlib's arrangement and for the reason its module docstring gives: the duplication is in statements only, since each logarithmic proof reduces to the multiplicative one. Never define a logarithmic height independently. |
| relative or absolute | **Both, distinguished by name.** Over a fixed `K`, `Height.mulHeight` is the *relative* height, which is the `[K : ℚ]`-th power of the absolute one; the absolute height carries the `abs` prefix, following Mathlib's `NumberField.absMulHeight₁`. Never divide by the degree inside a definition stated over a fixed `K`. |
| the local factor at a place | `⨆ i, v (x i)`, an `iSup` over the index type, as in Mathlib's `NumberField.mulHeight_eq`; archimedean places carry the weight `InfinitePlace.mult`. Not `Finset.sup'`, not a fold over a list. |
| a name for the local sup norm | **None.** `⨆ i, v (x i)` is written out. Mathlib has no such predicate and we do not add one; a one-line expression does not get a wrapper that would then need its own theory. |
| relative or absolute, in the literature | Bombieri–Gubler's `h` and `h_Ar` are **absolute** (their local exponent is `[F_w : ℚ_p] / [F : ℚ]`, 2.8.1–2.8.2). Mathlib's `Height.mulHeight` is **relative**. Every citation below says which, and every theorem transcribed from the book is stated with the `abs`-prefixed height unless it is explicitly renormalized. Constants transport the same way: an archimedean constant `c` in an absolute-height bound becomes `c ^ totalWeight K` in the relative height, one factor per archimedean place counted with multiplicity, which is why Mathlib's `mulHeight₁_sum_le` carries `#s ^ totalWeight K` and every Layer 2 bound below does the same. A relative bound with the absolute constant fails over any field of degree `> 1`. |
| the archimedean norm | Mathlib's height uses the **sup norm at every place**. The literature's Siegel-lemma constants are stated for the **Arakelov height**, which uses the ℓ² norm at archimedean places. Both exist here, `Height.mulHeight` (Mathlib's, primary) and `NumberField.arakelovMulHeight` (Layer 0), related by a named comparison lemma. Every bound says which one it is in. |
| junk values | `mulHeight 0 = 1` and `logHeight 0 = 0`, as in Mathlib; `absMulHeight₁` is `1` on a transcendental. No `⊥`, no `Option`, no `WithTop`. Every theorem whose content fails at the junk value carries the hypothesis that rules it out (`x ≠ 0`, `IsAlgebraic ℚ x`), rather than a different definition. |
| declaration names | **Statement-named, as Mathlib names things**: `polyMulHeight_mul_le`, `exists_basis_prod_absMulHeight_le`. The person's name — Siegel, Bombieri–Vaaler, Northcott, Kronecker, Gauss, Gelfond, Schmidt, Minkowski — goes in the docstring, never in the identifier. The exception Mathlib itself makes is a name that *is* the standard name of an object rather than of a theorem, such as `Northcott` the typeclass or `mahlerMeasure`. |
| the height of a subspace | `Submodule.mulHeight V := Projectivization.mulHeight V.pluckerPoint`, the height of the Plücker point, following Schmidt. Plücker coordinates are indexed by `Set.powersetCard ι k`, the type of `k`-element `Finset`s, matching `Module.Basis.exteriorPower`, **not** by strictly monotone `Fin k → ι` and not by a lexicographic list. |
| the height of a matrix | `Matrix.mulHeight A` is the height of the tuple of **entries**. The height of the row space — `H(A)` in Bombieri–Vaaler, the height of the tuple of maximal **minors** — is `Submodule.mulHeight (rowSpace A)` and never called the height of `A`. The two are different numbers and the classical literature uses one symbol for both; we do not. |
| duality | `V^⊥` is the **annihilator in the dual**, `Submodule.dualAnnihilator`, transported back to `ι → K` along the standard basis — the carrier of Bombieri–Gubler Proposition 2.8.10 and the one Mathlib's `ExteriorPower/Pairing.lean` substrate is written for. The orthogonal-complement form for `∑ i, x i * y i` is a derived corollary. |
| `S` for S-units | `S : Set (IsDedekindDomain.HeightOneSpectrum (𝓞 K))`, **finite places only**, with the infinite places always implicitly present — the carrier of Mathlib's `S.integer K` and `S.unit K` in `Mathlib/RingTheory/DedekindDomain/SInteger.lean`, which Layer 6 consumes and does not redefine, of `Mathlib/RingTheory/DedekindDomain/SelmerGroup.lean`, and of mathlib4#40791, whose rank formula `(r₁ + r₂ - 1) + |S|` fixes this reading. ⚠ Bombieri–Gubler 1.5.10 takes the opposite convention, `S ⊆ M_K` **including** all archimedean places, and so states the rank as `\|S\| - 1` (Theorem 1.5.13). The two agree, since `\|S_BG\| = r₁ + r₂ + \|S\|`; a contributor reading the book must translate, and every statement here says which convention it is in. |

## What Mathlib already has (consume)

This roadmap sits directly on `Mathlib/NumberTheory/Height/`; read that tree before writing
anything. **Reuse these by name; do not rebuild them.**

- **The height framework.** `Height.AdmissibleAbsValues` (a `Multiset` of archimedean and a `Set` of
  nonarchimedean absolute values, finite support, and the product formula), `Height.totalWeight`,
  `Height.mulHeight₁`/`logHeight₁` for a field element, `Height.mulHeight`/`logHeight` for a tuple,
  `Finsupp.mulHeight`, and the full basic API around them: scaling invariance
  (`mulHeight_smul_eq_mulHeight`), `one_le_mulHeight`, behaviour under `Equiv` and under reindexing,
  powers, inverses, products and sums (`mulHeight₁_mul_le`, `mulHeight₁_sum_le`), and `positivity`
  extensions.
- **The projective height.** `Projectivization.mulHeight`/`logHeight`, defined by `lift` from a
  representative tuple, with its own `positivity` extensions.
- **The number-field instance.** `NumberField.instAdmissibleAbsValues`, built from
  `multisetInfinitePlace` (infinite places with multiplicity `InfinitePlace.mult`) and
  `{v | IsFinitePlace v}`; `NumberField.mulHeight_eq`, which is exactly the classical local formula
  `∏_{v | ∞} (⨆ i, v (xᵢ))^{mult v} · ∏ᶠ_{v ∤ ∞} ⨆ i, v (xᵢ)`; `totalWeight_eq_finrank`; and
  `absNorm_mul_finprod_finitePlace_eq_one`, which identifies the finite part of the height of an
  integral tuple with the absolute norm of the ideal it generates.
- **The absolute height of an element.** `NumberField.absMulHeight₁`/`absLogHeight₁`, defined for
  any `[CharZero K]` through `ℚ⟮x⟯`, with the junk value `1` off the algebraic numbers.
- **Northcott.** The `Northcott` typeclass (`Mathlib/Order/Northcott.lean`, T. Browning) with
  `Northcott.exists_min_image` and `Northcott.comp_of_bddAbove`;
  `NumberField.finite_setOfPred_mulHeight₁_le` and the instances `Northcott (mulHeight₁ (K := K))`,
  `Northcott (logHeight₁ (K := K))`.
- **Heights over `ℚ`.** `Rat.mulHeight₁_eq_max` (`mulHeight₁ q = max |q.num| q.den`),
  `Rat.mulHeight_eq_max_abs_of_gcd_eq_one`, `Rat.mulHeight₁_natCast`.
- **Linear and polynomial maps.** `Height.mulHeight_linearMap_apply_le`, and the two-sided bounds
  `Height.mulHeight_eval_le`/`mulHeight_eval_ge` for a family of homogeneous polynomials of equal
  degree, with `Height.mulHeightBound` as the coefficient bound.
- **Mahler measure.** `Polynomial.mahlerMeasure`/`logMahlerMeasure` over `ℂ`
  (`Mathlib/Analysis/Polynomial/MahlerMeasure.lean`) with multiplicativity `mahlerMeasure_mul` and
  the Jensen formula `logMahlerMeasure_eq_log_leadingCoeff_add_sum_log_roots`; and over `ℤ`
  (`Mathlib/NumberTheory/MahlerMeasure.lean`, F. Barroero) Northcott for the Mahler measure
  (`finite_mahlerMeasure_le`) and the Kronecker statement for polynomials
  (`pow_eq_one_of_mahlerMeasure_eq_one`, `isPrimitiveRoot_of_mahlerMeasure_eq_one`).
- **Siegel's lemma over `ℤ`.** `Int.Matrix.exists_ne_zero_int_vec_norm_le` (F. Barroero, L. Capuano,
  A. Turchet): for a nonzero `m × n` integer matrix `A` with `m < n`, a nonzero integer solution of
  `A x = 0` with `‖x‖ ≤ (n · max 1 ‖A‖)^{m/(n−m)}` in the sup norm.
- **The unit theorem, in full.** `NumberField.Units.logEmbedding`, `unitLattice`,
  `unitLattice_span_eq_top`, `unitLattice_rank`, `rank`, `finrank_eq`, `basisModTorsion`,
  `fundSystem`, `exist_unique_eq_mul_prod`, `closure_fundSystem_sup_torsion_eq_top`,
  `logEmbedding_ker` (the kernel is the torsion subgroup), and `NumberField.Units.regulator` as the
  covolume of the unit lattice. **Layer 6 consumes all of this and re-proves none of it.** Note that
  `logEmbedding` lands in `{w // w ≠ w₀} → ℝ`: it omits a distinguished place `w₀`, and 6.1 is
  stated accordingly.
- **`S`-integers and `S`-units.** `Set.integer` (the subalgebra of `S`-integers) and `Set.unit` (the
  subgroup of `S`-units of `Kˣ`) in `Mathlib/RingTheory/DedekindDomain/SInteger.lean`, for
  `S : Set (HeightOneSpectrum R)`, with `Set.unitEquivUnitsInteger` and `integer_empty`. Layer 6
  uses these carriers and defines no `S`-object of its own; the `S`-unit *theorem* is not there.
- **Places and the product formula.** `NumberField.InfinitePlace` with `mult`,
  `NumberField.FinitePlace`, `IsInfinitePlace`/`IsFinitePlace`, and `NumberField.prod_abs_eq_one`.
- **Exterior powers.** `⋀[R]^n M`, `exteriorPower.ιMulti`, `exteriorPower.map`, the pairing with the
  dual (`ExteriorPower/Pairing.lean`), and — the one Layer 3 is built on —
  `Module.Basis.exteriorPower : Basis (Set.powersetCard I n) R (⋀[R]^n M)` with its `basis_apply`,
  `basis_repr` and `coe_basis` API.
- **Geometry of numbers.** `ZLattice`, `ZLattice.covolume`,
  `MeasureTheory.exists_ne_zero_mem_lattice_of_measure_mul_two_pow_le_measure` (Minkowski's
  convex-body theorem), `NumberField.mixedEmbedding` with the convex bodies and
  `NumberField.mixedEmbedding.volume_fundamentalDomain_latticeBasis` around it, and
  `NumberField.discr`.

## What is missing (build here)

Nothing above gives: the Arakelov normalization or its comparison with the sup-norm height; the
absolute height of a *tuple*; invariance under field extension; Northcott's theorem for varying
degree; Kronecker's theorem for the height (as opposed to for the Mahler measure); the height of a
polynomial, of a matrix, or of a subspace; Plücker coordinates as an arithmetic object; successive
minima, Minkowski's second theorem, the extraction lemma, or the cube-slicing bound; Siegel's
lemma over a number field or in the invariant Bombieri–Vaaler form; or the S-unit theorem.
`Suggested.lean` pins the signatures most likely to drift.

## The build, in layers

### Layer 0: normalizations and the extension dictionary

The layer that makes every later constant meaningful.

**0.1 The Arakelov height.** For a number field `K` define
`NumberField.arakelovMulHeight (x : ι → K)` as
`(∏ v : InfinitePlace K, (∑ i, v (x i) ^ 2) ^ (v.mult / 2 : ℝ)) * ∏ᶠ v : FinitePlace K, ⨆ i, v (x i)`
for `x ≠ 0`, and `1` at `x = 0` — the same junk value as `Height.mulHeight`, so that the displayed
product (which is `0` at the zero tuple) does not falsify `1 ≤ arakelovMulHeight` or the
unconditional comparisons of 0.2. State the displayed formula as `arakelovMulHeight_eq`, hypothesis
`x ≠ 0`. Add `arakelovLogHeight` its logarithm and `arakelovMulHeight₁ x := arakelovMulHeight ![x, 1]`
the one-variable (affine) case, with its logarithm. Prove the same basic API Mathlib proves for
`mulHeight`: scaling invariance under `Kˣ`, hence a well-defined descent to `Projectivization`;
`1 ≤ arakelovMulHeight`; invariance under reindexing.

**0.2 The comparison.** `mulHeight x ≤ arakelovMulHeight x` and, for `ι` nonempty,
`arakelovMulHeight x ≤ (Fintype.card ι : ℝ) ^ (totalWeight K / 2 : ℝ) * mulHeight x`, from
`‖·‖_∞ ≤ ‖·‖_2 ≤ √n ‖·‖_∞` place by place, with `Height.totalWeight_eq_finrank` supplying the
exponent (on the empty index type both heights are the junk value `1` and the right-hand side is
`0`, so `[Nonempty ι]` is a hypothesis, not a convenience). This is the lemma that transports every
constant in the Siegel-lemma literature into
Mathlib's normalization, and Layer 5 states its bounds in terms of it. Prove also that the two agree
when `ι` is a subsingleton, where both are `1`. ⚠ This is *not* the statement
`arakelovMulHeight₁ = mulHeight₁`, which is **false**: the archimedean local factor of
`arakelovMulHeight₁` is `((v x) ^ 2 + 1) ^ (v.mult / 2)` and not `max (v x) 1 ^ v.mult`, so already
`arakelovMulHeight₁ (1 : K) = 2 ^ (totalWeight K / 2 : ℝ)` while `mulHeight₁ (1 : K) = 1`. The two
one-variable heights are related only by the comparison above, applied to `![x, 1]`.

**0.3 Extension invariance.** For `K ⊆ L` a finite extension of number fields:
`mulHeight₁_pow_finrank`, `mulHeight₁ x ^ finrank K L = mulHeight₁ (algebraMap K L x)`; the tuple
form `mulHeight_pow_finrank`; and the logarithmic forms `finrank_nsmul_logHeight₁` and
`finrank_nsmul_logHeight`. The route is that each place of `K` is the restriction of the places of
`L` above it, with `∑_{w | v} [L_w : K_v] = [L : K]`; the bridging lemma
`NumberField.InfinitePlace.liesOver_iff_comap_eq` is itself part of mathlib4#41606, not of Mathlib,
so build it here under that name as the first step. These are the statements of mathlib4#41606 and
carry its names. The special case `K = ℚ`, `H_L(x) = H_ℚ(x)^{[L : ℚ]}`, needs no places above
places and is the acceptance test for the general statement.

**0.4 The absolute height of a tuple.** `NumberField.absMulHeight (x : ι → K)` for `[CharZero K]`,
defined as `mulHeight` computed over `IntermediateField.adjoin ℚ (Set.range x)` and normalized by
the inverse of its degree — the tuple analogue of Mathlib's `absMulHeight₁` and its exact
generalization (`absMulHeight` of `![x, 1]` is `absMulHeight₁ x`). Prove `absMulHeight_eq`, the
tuple analogue of #41606's `absMulHeight₁_eq`: over *any* number field `K` containing the
coordinates, `absMulHeight x = mulHeight x ^ (finrank ℚ K : ℝ)⁻¹` — which, with 0.3, is exactly the
classical statement that the absolute height is independent of the field of definition. Prove the
scaling invariance `absMulHeight (c • x) = absMulHeight x` for `c ≠ 0` **algebraic**, and descend
to `Projectivization K (ι → K)` over a field with `[Algebra.IsAlgebraic ℚ K]` — a number field, or
`AlgebraicClosure ℚ`. Neither holds over a general `[CharZero K]`: for `c` transcendental and `x`
a nonzero algebraic tuple, `c • x` has a transcendental coordinate and its absolute height is the
junk value `1`, so `absMulHeight` is not constant on the line through `x` and does not descend to
`Projectivization K (ι → K)`. The definition is made for `[CharZero K]`, as Mathlib's
`absMulHeight₁` is; the projective theory is stated over algebraic fields.

### Layer 1: Northcott, Kronecker, and the Mahler-measure bridge

**1.1 Northcott on projective space.** The `Northcott` instances for `Projectivization.mulHeight`
and `Projectivization.logHeight` over a number field, which
`Mathlib/NumberTheory/Height/Northcott.lean` records as its own TODO. Route: a projective point has
a representative with coordinates in `𝓞 K` generating an ideal of norm bounded by the height, and
`NumberField.absNorm_mul_finprod_finitePlace_eq_one` converts that into the finite part. ⚠ There is
no `Northcott` instance for `Height.mulHeight` on `ι → K` itself, and none is to be stated:
`mulHeight_smul_eq_mulHeight` puts the whole line `Kˣ • x` at one height, so
`{x : ι → K | mulHeight x ≤ B}` is infinite for every `B ≥ 1` and nonempty `ι`. Finiteness of
tuples of bounded height needs a normalization — coordinates in `𝓞 K` with a fixed nonzero
coordinate, say — and that is a lemma inside the proof, not an instance.

**1.2 Height and Mahler measure** (Bombieri–Gubler, Proposition 1.6.6 and Lemma 1.6.7). For `x`
algebraic over `ℚ` let `f ∈ ℤ[X]` be its **primitive integer minimal polynomial**: the primitive
polynomial with `f(x) = 0` that is irreducible in `ℤ[X]`, unique up to sign by Gauss's lemma, and
a rational multiple of `minpoly ℚ x`. With `D = natDegree f`, `absMulHeight₁ x ^ D = M(f)`, i.e.
`H(x) = M(f)^{1/D}`; state it with `f` quantified under the hypotheses `f.IsPrimitive` and
`f.map (Int.castRingHom ℚ) = C c * minpoly ℚ x` for some `c ≠ 0`, which pin `f` up to sign
without resolving the sign, and which force `x` algebraic. ⚠ `f` is
**not** `minpoly ℤ x`: Mathlib defines `minpoly ℤ x = 0` whenever `x` is not integral over `ℤ`, so
a statement through `minpoly ℤ x` is false for `x = 1/2` (left side `2`, right side `M(0) = 0`)
unless it carries `IsIntegral ℤ x`, and with that hypothesis it covers only algebraic integers and
cannot feed 1.3. Route: Jensen's formula
(`Polynomial.logMahlerMeasure_eq_log_leadingCoeff_add_sum_log_roots`) computes `M(f)` as the leading
coefficient times `∏ max(1, |root|)`, and the archimedean part of the height over the splitting
field is the same product, while the finite part is the leading coefficient by Gauss's lemma. This
identity is the workhorse of the rest of the layer.

**1.3 Northcott's theorem** (Bombieri–Gubler, Theorem 1.6.8; Hindry–Silverman, Theorem B.2.3, which
states it projectively and with varying degree, in exactly the form wanted here). For `B : ℝ` and
`D : ℕ`, the set `{x : ℚ̄ | absMulHeight₁ x ≤ B ∧ finrank ℚ ℚ⟮x⟯ ≤ D}` is finite — the statement
with *varying* degree, which is what "Northcott's theorem" names in the literature and which
Mathlib's fixed-field `finite_setOfPred_mulHeight₁_le` does not give. Route: 1.2 bounds the Mahler
measure of the primitive integer minimal polynomial, whose degree is at most `D`, hence (through
Mathlib's `Polynomial.finite_mahlerMeasure_le`) leaves finitely many such polynomials, each with
finitely many roots. State the projective version for `Projectivization ℚ̄ (ι → ℚ̄)` alongside it.

**1.4 Kronecker's theorem** (Bombieri–Gubler, Theorem 1.5.9; Hindry–Silverman, Corollary B.2.3.1).
For `x` algebraic over `ℚ`, `absMulHeight₁ x = 1 ↔ x = 0 ∨ ∃ n, 0 < n ∧ x ^ n = 1`, and the strict
form `absLogHeight₁ x = 0 ↔ …`. Route: through 1.2 and Mathlib's
`Polynomial.isPrimitiveRoot_of_mahlerMeasure_eq_one`; the direct route through 1.3 applied to the
orbit `{x ^ n}` — which has bounded height by `mulHeight₁_pow` and bounded degree — is an
alternative proof and a good acceptance test that the two agree. State the **projective** form
alongside it, as Hindry–Silverman B.2.3.1 does: for `P ∈ ℙⁿ(ℚ̄)`, `mulHeight P = 1` if and only if
every defined ratio `x j / x i` is zero or a root of unity. Record also the corollary that a nonzero
algebraic **integer** all of whose conjugates lie in the closed unit disc is a root of unity.

**1.5 Lower bounds away from one.** `1 < absMulHeight₁ x` for `x` algebraic, nonzero, not a root of
unity, and the effective consequence that for each `D` there is `c > 0` with `absLogHeight₁ x ≥ c`
for every such `x` of degree at most `D` — an immediate corollary of 1.3 and 1.4, and the shape in
which Diophantine arguments consume this layer.

### Layer 2: heights of polynomials, linear forms, and matrices

**2.1 The height of a polynomial.** `Polynomial.mulHeight p := Finsupp.mulHeight p.toFinsupp.coeff`
and `MvPolynomial.mulHeight p := Finsupp.mulHeight p.coeff` — both are literally `Finsupp` s over
`K`, so Mathlib's `Finsupp.mulHeight` is the definition and nothing new is constructed. Prove the
basic API: invariance under scaling by `Kˣ`; `mulHeight (C a) = 1` for every `a` (a one-entry
tuple has height `1` by the product formula, `mulHeight_eq_one_of_subsingleton`, and the zero
polynomial takes the junk value), so the value on monomials is `1` too; the compatibility with
Mathlib's affine height, `mulHeight (X - C a) = mulHeight₁ a`, since `![-a, 1]` and `![a, 1]` have
the same height; behaviour under `Polynomial.map` along a field embedding; and the relation to the
tuple height of the coefficient vector on `Fin (natDegree p + 1)`. ⚠ `mulHeight (C a) = mulHeight₁ a`
is false (`a = 2` over `ℚ`: left side `1`, right side `2`); `mulHeight₁ a` is the height of the
*two*-entry tuple `![a, 1]`.

**2.2 Gauss's lemma for heights** (Bombieri–Gubler, Lemma 1.6.3; Hindry–Silverman §B.7). At every
nonarchimedean place `v`, the local factor is multiplicative:
`⨆ (v ∘ coeff (p * q)) = (⨆ v ∘ coeff p) * (⨆ v ∘ coeff q)`. This is the content of Gauss's lemma
and the only place the ultrametric inequality is used sharply; Mathlib's
`IsNonarchimedean.apply_sum_le` is the input.

**2.3 Gelfond's inequality** (Bombieri–Gubler, Lemma 1.6.11; Hindry–Silverman, Proposition B.7.3,
where it is spelled *Gelfand's* inequality — the attribution is to A. O. Gelfond and both spellings
are in print, so the docstring carries both; the elementary converse is their Proposition B.7.2).
The archimedean loss is at most a power of two per archimedean place. In the absolute height the
constant is `2 ^ (deg p + deg q)`; in Mathlib's relative height, which Layer 2 is stated in, it is
`2 ^ ((natDegree p + natDegree q) * totalWeight K)`:
`mulHeight (p * q) ≤ 2 ^ ((natDegree p + natDegree q) * totalWeight K) * mulHeight p * mulHeight q`
and the reverse
`mulHeight p * mulHeight q ≤ 2 ^ ((natDegree p + natDegree q) * totalWeight K) * mulHeight (p * q)`.
The local inequality at one archimedean place is the book's; the relative height raises it to the
power `mult v` and multiplies over the places, and `totalWeight_eq_sum_mult` collects the exponent.
Prove the multivariate form for `MvPolynomial` with the total degree in the exponent. Record the sharp
multiplicative statement `M(pq) = M(p) M(q)` as a consequence of Mathlib's `mahlerMeasure_mul`, and
the comparison between `mulHeight p` and `mahlerMeasure p` in both directions, which is what makes
the exponent `2^deg` unavoidable and the Mahler measure the sharper tool.

**2.4 Linear forms and the Segre relation.** Mathlib has the Segre relation
`h(x ⊗ y) = h(x) + h(y)` (Bombieri–Gubler 1.5.14) as `Height.mulHeight_fun_mul_eq`, and the sum
bound for field elements `h(P₁ + ⋯ + P_r) ≤ ∑ h(P_i) + log r` (Proposition 1.5.15, absolute) as
`mulHeight₁_sum_le`, whose relative constant is `#s ^ totalWeight K` — already the sharp one; there
is nothing to sharpen there. What is missing is the **tuple** form: for a tuple `w : β → K` and an
index map `f : α → ι → β`, `mulHeight (fun i ↦ ∑ a ∈ s, w (f a i)) ≤ #s ^ totalWeight K * mulHeight w`,
the statement that sums of coordinates of one projective point cost `#s ^ totalWeight K`. ⚠ The
naive tuple statement `mulHeight (x + y) ≤ C · mulHeight x · mulHeight y` is **false** for every
`C`: scale `y` by `c ∈ Kˣ`, which fixes the right-hand side and sends `mulHeight (x + c • y)` to
infinity; the sum bound for tuples is a statement about one tuple, not two. A linear form is a
degree-one polynomial and its height is 2.1 applied to it; no separate definition. What this
milestone owns beyond the tuple sum bound is the estimates for the value `∑ i, a i * x i` against
the heights of `a` and `x`: in the sup-norm height the constant is `(card ι) ^ totalWeight K`, and
in the Arakelov normalization of Layer 0 Cauchy–Schwarz at each archimedean place removes the
cardinality altogether.

**2.5 The height of a matrix** (Bombieri–Gubler's `H(A)`, 2.9.8).
`Matrix.mulHeight A := Height.mulHeight fun p : ι' × ι ↦ A p.1 p.2`, with `logHeight` alongside.
Prove: invariance under `Matrix.transpose` and under row and column permutations; scaling by `Kˣ`;
the submatrix bound `mulHeight (A.submatrix f g) ≤ mulHeight A`; the product bound, for the inner
index type `ι` nonempty,
`mulHeight (A * B) ≤ (Fintype.card ι : ℝ) ^ totalWeight K * mulHeight A * mulHeight B`, whose
local form is the triangle inequality on a sum of `card ι` terms at each archimedean place and
exact multiplicativity at the nonarchimedean ones; and the bound on the height of `A.det` in terms
of `mulHeight A` and the size, from the Leibniz expansion. Consume
`Height.mulHeight_linearMap_apply_le` for the action on tuples rather than reproving it. Two
rejection tests for the product bound: over `ℚ(i)`, `A = [1 1]` and `B = [[N, 0], [N, 1]]` give
`A B = [2N, 1]` with `H(AB) = 4N²`, `H(A) = 1`, `H(B) = N²`, so the absolute constant `card ι = 2`
fails and the relative one `2 ^ 2 = 4` is sharp; and for `ι` empty, `A B = 0` has the junk height
`1` against a right-hand side of `0`, which is why `[Nonempty ι]` is a hypothesis.

### Layer 3: Plücker coordinates and the height of a subspace

The layer this roadmap exists for. Throughout, `V : Submodule K (ι → K)` with `[Fintype ι]`,
`[LinearOrder ι]` (see *Standing hypotheses*) and `Module.finrank K V = k`.

**3.1 The Plücker point** (Hindry–Silverman, Exercise A.1.11(a)–(b); Bombieri–Gubler 2.8.4). For a
basis `b : Fin k → V`, the wedge `⋀ i, (b i : ι → K) ∈ ⋀[K]^k (ι → K)` is nonzero, and its
coordinate vector in
`(Pi.basisFun K ι).exteriorPower k : Basis (Set.powersetCard ι k) K (⋀[K]^k (ι → K))` is a nonzero
element of `Set.powersetCard ι k → K`. A change of basis multiplies the wedge by the determinant of
the change-of-basis matrix, a unit, so the induced point
`Submodule.pluckerPoint V : Projectivization K (Set.powersetCard ι k → K)` is independent of the
basis. Build it exactly as Mathlib builds `Projectivization.mulHeight`: a private well-definedness
lemma feeding `Projectivization.lift`, with the body unexposed. Prove injectivity — distinct
subspaces of the same rank have distinct Plücker points — which is what entitles this to be called
an embedding.

**3.2 The height of a subspace.**
`Submodule.mulHeight V := Projectivization.mulHeight V.pluckerPoint`, with `logHeight`,
`arakelovMulHeight` and (over `ℚ̄`) `absMulHeight` alongside, each defined from the corresponding
height of the Plücker point. Basic API: `1 ≤ mulHeight V`; `mulHeight ⊥ = 1` and `mulHeight ⊤ = 1`,
the two rank-zero and rank- `n` degenerate cases where the exterior power is a line; and the
compatibility that makes the definition the right one,
`Submodule.mulHeight (span K {x}) = Height.mulHeight x` for `x ≠ 0`, so the height of a line **is**
the projective height of the point it defines.

**3.3 The matrix dictionary** (Bombieri–Gubler, Remark 2.8.7). For `A : Matrix (Fin m) ι K` of full
row rank, the Plücker point of the row space is the tuple of maximal minors,
`minorDet A s = (A.submatrix id (Set.powersetCard.orderIsoOfFin s)).det` — the order isomorphism
being the index identification, pinned here once so that no later statement re-chooses it. Hence
`subspaceMulHeight (rowSpace A)` is the **sup-norm** height of the vector of maximal minors, and
its Arakelov variant of 3.2, `arakelovSubspaceMulHeight (rowSpace A)`, is `H_Ar^row(A)` in the
classical literature (Definition 2.8.11); per the conventions above, neither is
`matrixMulHeight A`. Bombieri–Gubler use both and distinguish them exactly this way: their
`H(A)` (2.9.8) is the height of the entries, their `H_Ar(A)` the height of the row space. Prove the
invariance this buys: `mulHeight (rowSpace (U * A)) = mulHeight (rowSpace A)` for `U` invertible
(Bombieri–Vaaler (2.5), where it is the statement that the height is *intrinsic on the Grassmannian*
rather than a property of the matrix), which is the invariance under row operations that the naïve
Siegel bound lacks.

**3.4 The Cauchy–Binet identity** (Schmidt 1967, §2 Lemma 1; Bombieri–Gubler, Proposition 2.8.8;
Bombieri–Vaaler (2.4)(iv)). The statement to prove is the ring-generic one: for `A, B` of size
`m × n` over a commutative ring, `det (A Bᵀ) = ∑_S det A_S · det B_S`, the sum over the
`m`-element column sets `S`, in the `minorDet` indexing of 3.3. Its two archimedean
specializations are what the ℓ² local factor of the minor vector needs: at a **real** place
`B = A` gives `∑ s, (det A_s)² = det (A Aᵀ)`, the Gram determinant of the rows; at a **complex**
place `B = conj A` gives `∑ s, |det A_s|² = det (A A*)` with the conjugate transpose. State both;
the real one alone leaves the Bombieri–Vaaler constant available only over totally real fields.
This is a named milestone rather than a step inside a proof, because it is precisely where the
`√|det (A Aᵀ)|` of the Bombieri–Vaaler bound is produced. Prove alongside it the **generalized
Hadamard inequality**
(Schmidt 1967, §2 Lemma 2; Bombieri–Vaaler (2.6); Bombieri–Gubler's Fischer inequality, Remark
2.8.9): for a partition of the rows into two blocks, `H_u(A) ≤ H_u(A₁) · H_u(A₂)`. That is what
turns a row-space bound into a bound in terms of individual rows (5.5).

**3.5 Duality** (Schmidt 1967, §1, equations (2) and (4) — the original; Bombieri–Gubler,
Proposition 2.8.10; the underlying linear algebra is Hindry–Silverman, Exercise A.1.11(c), which
identifies `W` as the orthogonal complement of `ker δ'(w)`). Schmidt's mechanism is the sharpest
statement of the route: the involution `τ` on Grassmann coordinates that **reverses the index order
and attaches a sign** satisfies `S^{⊥*} = τ(S*)`, so duality holds for any distance function
invariant under that signed reversal — which both the sup norm and the ℓ² norm are, so the theorem
holds in both normalizations of Layer 0 and needs no separate proof for each.
`Submodule.mulHeight V = Submodule.mulHeight V.dualAnnihilator`, the annihilator transported back to
`ι → K` along the standard basis. Equivalently (Corollary 2.8.12): the height of a subspace equals
the height of any matrix cutting it out, `mulHeight (ker A) = mulHeight (rowSpace A)`. Route: the
complementation isomorphism `⋀^k V ≅ ⋀^n V ⊗ ⋀^{n−k} V*` carries canonical basis vectors to
canonical basis vectors up to sign, so the two coordinate tuples agree up to a signed reindexing,
and `Height.mulHeight_comp_equiv` with `Height.mulHeight_neg` finishes it. State the
orthogonal-complement corollary for the standard bilinear form alongside.

**3.6 Submodularity** (Bombieri–Gubler, Theorem 2.8.13; Schmidt, and independently
Struppeck–Vaaler). `h_Ar(V + W) + h_Ar(V ∩ W) ≤ h_Ar(V) + h_Ar(W)`: the height is submodular on the
subspace lattice. Bombieri–Gubler state it without proof and do not use it; it is nonetheless the
structural theorem about subspace heights. State with it the two corollaries it has together with
`1 ≤ H`: `H(V ⊓ W) ≤ H(V) · H(W)` and `H(V ⊔ W) ≤ H(V) · H(W)`. ⚠ Subspace heights are **not
monotone under inclusion**, and no statement bounding `H(W)` by `H(V)` for `W ≤ V` is to be
made: in `ℚ²`, `H(⊤) = 1` while the line spanned by `![1, N]` has height `N`. In particular the
basis vectors of a subspace are not bounded by its height; Layer 5 bounds the vectors it produces
through the successive minima, never through the height of the space they span.

**3.7 Northcott for subspaces.** Over a number field,
`{V : Submodule K (ι → K) | finrank K V = k ∧ mulHeight V ≤ B}` is finite, and the `Northcott`
instance behind it, immediate from 3.1's injectivity and Layer 1.1.

### Layer 4: successive minima, Minkowski's second theorem, extraction, and cube slicing

Minkowski's convex-body theorem is Mathlib's; the second theorem is not, and Bombieri–Vaaler needs
it, together with two lemmas that convert its real-lattice output into number-field statements:
the extraction lemma (4.4) and the cube-slicing theorem (4.5). The reduced fundamental system of
6.3 needs it too, together with the lemma that turns the minima into a lattice basis (4.6).
Everything in this layer is stated
against Mathlib's `ZLattice`, `ZLattice.covolume` and `mixedEmbedding`, with the ambient measure a
Haar measure (`[IsAddHaarMeasure (volume : Measure E)]`), which is the hypothesis every covolume
statement in Mathlib carries.

**4.1 Successive minima** (Cassels, Ch. VIII §1). For a `ZLattice L` in a finite-dimensional real
normed space `E` of dimension `n` and a symmetric convex body `B` — **compact**, convex, symmetric,
with nonempty interior — define `successiveMinimum L B i` as the infimum of `t > 0` such that
`t • B` contains `i + 1` linearly independent points of `L`. For `i ≥ n` no such family exists and
the value is `sInf ∅ = 0`, so every statement about the minima carries `i < n`. Prove it is
attained — Cassels' Lemma 1 of that section, the existence of independent lattice vectors
realizing the minima, which every later proof consumes; this is where closedness of `B` is used —
and positive — where boundedness is used: a bounded body meets the discrete lattice in finitely
many points at each dilation — monotone in `i`, and homogeneous of degree `−1` in `B`; and that
`successiveMinimum L B 0` is the quantity bounded by Minkowski's first theorem, so Mathlib's
`exists_ne_zero_mem_lattice_of_measure_mul_two_pow_le_measure` is the `i = 0` case.

⚠ Cassels indexes the minima by a **distance function** `F`, taking `𝒮 = {x | F x ≤ 1}` and dilating
that, rather than by a convex body and `t • B`. The two are the same thing and Mathlib's `gauge` is
the translation, since the gauge of a symmetric convex body with `0` in its interior is exactly such
an `F`. **The convex-body form above is the pinned one**, because it is what Mathlib's first theorem
is already stated in; prove the `gauge` correspondence once, as its own lemma, so the book's
statements transfer without re-deriving anything.

**4.2 Minkowski's second theorem** (Cassels, Ch. VIII, Theorem II for a general distance function).
With `n = finrank ℝ E` and `B` as in 4.1, `(2ⁿ / n!) · covolume L ≤ (∏ i < n, λ i) · vol B` and
`(∏ i < n, λ i) · vol B ≤ 2ⁿ · covolume L`. The first follows from the first theorem applied to a
scaled body; the second is the substantial half, by the compression argument along a basis
realizing the minima. Both are milestones; the second is the one Layer 5 and 6.3 consume. Cassels'
Theorem I of the same chapter is the sphere case, and its Hadamard-inequality argument is the
skeleton of the general proof — Cassels says as much — so it is the model to read first; it is
not a separate target, since Theorem II contains it.

**4.3 The number-field lattice.** The specialization Layer 5 uses: for a subspace `V ⊆ Kⁿ` of
dimension `k`, the image of `V ∩ (𝓞 K)ⁿ` under `NumberField.mixedEmbedding` is a `ZLattice` of
rank `d k` in the `d k`-dimensional real carrier `V ⊗ ℝ`, and — with the measure normalized as
Mathlib's `volume_fundamentalDomain_latticeBasis` normalizes it, `ℂ ≅ ℝ²`, so that `𝓞 K` itself
has covolume `2^{−r₂} √|discr K|` — its covolume is

```text
covol (V ∩ (𝓞 K)ⁿ)  =  2^{−r₂ k} · |discr K|^{k/2} · H_Ar(V)^d,
```

with `H_Ar` the absolute Arakelov subspace height of Layers 0 and 3, so the last factor is the
*relative* Arakelov height.

This is not a formula to be derived here: it is **Schmidt 1967, §3, Theorem 1**, and in exactly the
normalization above. Schmidt's `ρ` is already the `(Re, Im)` embedding, his `Δ = 2^{−r₂} √|𝔡|`, and
his `H` already the Euclidean-`F` Grassmann height, so his `H'(S) = Δ^{−d} · d(ρ(I(S)))` and
`H'(S) = H(S)` are the display above verbatim. Thunder 1992 (Theorem 2) restates it in a
conjugate-pairs embedding, which is why no `2^{−r₂}` appears there, and Fukshansky 2006 ((17))
quotes it back in Schmidt's embedding with an absolute height. Cite Schmidt at the milestone: the
identity has a single point of truth in the literature too. His own warm-up computation
(`S = Kⁿ ⇒ d(Λ) = Δⁿ`, hence `H' = 1 = H`) is worth carrying as the degenerate acceptance check
beside the worked examples below, since it pins the `2^{−r₂}` and the discriminant power at once.

Prove it over `ℚ` first, where it says a saturated lattice has covolume the euclidean norm of its
primitive Plücker vector — Cauchy–Binet (3.4) plus completing a basis of the saturation to one of
`ℤⁿ`. Over `K`, **follow Schmidt's proof, which never decomposes the module and never meets the
class group**; a Steinitz pseudo-basis `Λ ≅ ⊕ 𝔞_l · w_l` is not the route. Pick *any*
`y₁, …, y_k ∈ V ∩ (𝓞 K)ⁿ` independent over `K` and let `Λ₀` be the lattice of the **free** module
`𝓞_K y₁ + ⋯ + 𝓞_K y_k`, a finite-index sublattice. Then two lemmas, one per side of the height:

- *Archimedean* (his Lemma 4): `covol Λ₀ = (2^{−r₂} |D|^{1/2})^k · ∏_i D(y₁^{(i)}, …, y_k^{(i)})`,
  the product over the embeddings of `K`, `D` the Gram determinant. The squared covolume is the sum
  of squares of maximal minors (Cauchy–Binet, 3.4); a Lagrange expansion in blocks of `d` rows
  factors `|D|^{k/2}` out through the integral-basis matrix and leaves the Plücker coordinates as
  the surviving minors. **The `2^{−r₂}` enters at exactly one point** — the `(Re, Im)` change of
  variables, contributing `2^{−2 r₂ k}` to the squared determinant — which is the single place a
  Lean proof can get this constant wrong.
- *Finite* (his Lemmas 5–6): `[σ(Λ) : Λ₀] = N(𝔞)`, with `𝔞` the ideal generated by the Plücker
  coordinates, reduced prime by prime to a counting lemma — for `det(R₁, …, R_k) ∈ 𝔭^e ∖ 𝔭^{e+1}`,
  the number of `B` mod `𝔭^f` with `B · R_j ≡ 0 (mod 𝔭^{g_j})` is `N(𝔭)^{k f − ∑ g_j + e}`, for
  `e ≤ g_j ≤ f` for every `j` — by induction on `e`. The range is where the count is clean: with
  `M` the matrix of the `R_j`, the solutions in `𝓞_𝔭^k` are `M⁻¹ (∏ 𝔭^{g_j})`, which lies in
  `𝓞_𝔭^k` since `M⁻¹ = adj M / det M` has entries in `𝔭^{−e}` and every `g_j ≥ e`, and has index
  `N(𝔭)^{∑ g_j − e}` there; and `g_j ≤ f` puts `𝔭^f 𝓞_𝔭^k` inside the solution lattice, so
  reducing mod `𝔭^f` divides `N(𝔭)^{k f}` by that index. The sign of `e` is fixed by the case
  `k = 1`: for `r ∈ 𝔭^e ∖ 𝔭^{e+1}` and `e ≤ g ≤ f`, `B r ∈ 𝔭^g` means `B ∈ 𝔭^{g − e}`, and there
  are `N(𝔭)^{f − g + e}` such `B` mod `𝔭^f`; a version with `−e` is refuted there.

Since the height is by definition `N(𝔞)^{−1}` times the archimedean product, the two `N(𝔞)` cancel.
Non-freeness of `V ∩ (𝓞 K)ⁿ` is therefore never confronted, and no ideal-class bookkeeping enters
this roadmap at any point; the `ℚ(√−5)` example below is a regression test against a Lean proof
silently assuming freeness, not a hard case. This is the computation that converts a lattice
statement into a height statement, and
it is where the `|D_{K/ℚ}|^{(N−M)/(2d)}` of 5.3 and 5.4 is produced; it is a named milestone so
that constant has a single point of truth, and the worked examples below pin each of its three
factors.

**4.4 The extraction lemma.** The bridge from 4.2's real independence to Layer 5's `K`-bases, and
pure linear algebra. If `u 1, …, u i ∈ Kⁿ` have `ℝ`-linearly independent images under the mixed
embedding, their `K`-span has dimension at least `i / d`: the embedding is `ℚ`-linear, and a
`K`-space of dimension `m` is a `ℚ`-space of dimension `d · m`. State it for an arbitrary tower —
`F ⊆ K` finite of degree `d`, a `K`-vector space, an `F`-linear map into a vector space over a
third field `E ⊇ F`, images independent over `E` — so the statement carries no number theory.
Prove with it the greedy selection it exists for: from `d · k` such vectors, `k` of them that are
`K`-linearly independent, the `j`-th chosen **among the first `d (j − 1) + 1`** — a member of the
family, never a linear combination, because a chosen lattice vector keeps the norm bound it
arrived with and a combination does not. Applied to independent vectors realizing the minima
`λ 1 ≤ ⋯ ≤ λ (d k)` of 4.2, monotonicity gives `λ_{d(j−1)+1} ^ d ≤ ∏_{r=1}^{d} λ_{d(j−1)+r}`, so
the product of the selected vectors' relative heights is bounded by `∏ i, λ i`, the full product
4.2 bounds, with no loss. This is the step Bombieri–Vaaler perform adelically: every known proof
of the second theorem needs, for a lattice and a sublattice, bases in which one is triangular
over the other, which over `(𝓞_K)^N` requires `𝓞_K` to be a principal ideal domain (their §I.3).
The lemma replaces the triangularization, and is what entitles the route below to the basis
statements 5.2 Theorem 2, 5.3 and 5.4 at their exact constants with no adelic input. The three
statements are the counting lemma in the arbitrary-tower form above, the greedy selection under
arbitrary index bounds, and the packaged corollary giving `k` from `d · k` with the `j`-th index at
most `d · j`; all three are general linear algebra with no number theory in them, and a sorry-free
proof of each exists (see *[Provenance](#provenance)*). What settles the shape of the roadmap's
route is that the adelic proofs need triangularization because their successive minima count
vectors independent **over `K`** (Bombieri–Gubler's Definition C.2.9 is explicit about this), which
a real convex body cannot see; 4.4 is precisely the price of that difference, and it is a page of
linear algebra.

**4.5 Cube slicing** (Vaaler 1979; Bombieri–Gubler, Appendix C.3). For a linear subspace
`V ⊆ ℝⁿ` of dimension `k`, the central slice of the cube satisfies
`vol_k (V ∩ [−1, 1]ⁿ) ≥ 2^k`, with equality on coordinate subspaces, so the bound is sharp. This
is the archimedean volume bound behind the sharp constants of Layer 5 — Bombieri–Vaaler's own proof
quotes it, so it is a cost of the theorem, not of this route.

**Take Bombieri–Gubler's actual statement, which is more general at no cost.** Their Theorem C.3.8
is the *product-of-balls* inequality: for any partition `n = n₁ + ⋯ + n_r` and
`Q = B_{ρ(n₁)} × ⋯ × B_{ρ(n_r)}` a product of balls **each of volume 1**, every central slice
satisfies `vol (Q ∩ V) ≥ 1`. The cube is the case `n_i ≡ 1`; the archimedean bodies this roadmap
needs are the case `n_i = 1` at real places and `n_i = 2` at complex ones. The generality is free —
the induction on `r` has a base case (polar decomposition, then a per-ray convexity comparison
against the volume-1 ball) and a step (log-concavity of the marginal) that never use `n_i = 1` — so
state 4.5 in this form and the complex places are covered by the same theorem. Two corollaries are
stated alongside it, both targets: the **cube case**, blocks of size one rescaled to `[−1, 1]ᴺ`,
slice volume at least `2^k`, which is what 5.2 consumes; and the **inscribed-cube bound at a
complex place**, that a `k`-dimensional complex subspace meets the unit polydisc of `ℂⁿ` in real
`2k`-volume at least `2^k`, because the polydisc contains the cube of half-side `1/√2` in
`ℝ^{2n}` and `(2/√2)^{2k} = 2^k`. The product-of-balls theorem gives `π^k` there instead, and the
factor `(π / 2)^{k r₂ / d}` between the two is exactly the gap between the two constants 5.4
states; the exact cancellation in the *Route* paragraph below is the acceptance check for the
inscribed-cube bound.

**Cost, priced from the source.** Bombieri–Gubler C.3 is a complete proof in five pages —
log-concave functions (C.3.1–2), the sup-convolution inequality (C.3.3), log-concavity of marginals
(C.3.4), the Gauss measure and its layer-cake representation (C.3.5),
`μ(A) ≤ vol (A ∩ Q)` by induction on the number of factors (C.3.7), and the theorem by an
`ε`-thickening of the subspace (C.3.8) — with **exactly one step imported**: C.3.3, which is
Prékopa 1973, Theorem 3. That theorem is itself a one-page induction on dimension off the
one-dimensional case, and Prékopa's own remark reduces the only case needed here (two functions,
both log-concave) to the `λ = ½` inequality of his 1971 paper by a dyadic argument he calls "very
easy". So the analytic ladder is four named rungs, not an open-ended development. What is genuinely
absent is Mathlib support: there is
no `LogConcave` predicate, no Prékopa–Leindler and no Brunn–Minkowski, so the milestone begins with
the definition. `Mathlib/MeasureTheory/Integral/Marginal.lean` (the `∫⋯∫⁻` API built for
Gagliardo–Nirenberg–Sobolev) is the right substrate for the induction over coordinates. One
formalization detail from Prékopa's own erratum: the sup-convolution is only *Lebesgue* measurable,
so state C.3.3 with a hypothesis `f x ^ λ * g y ^ μ ≤ r (λ • x + μ • y)` for a given measurable `r`
rather than defining `r` as a supremum. Vaaler's own proof runs through a peakedness comparison
for symmetric product measures (Kanter 1977); it proves the same theorem and is admissible, but
the milestone is priced against Bombieri–Gubler C.3.

**Route.** Bombieri–Gubler prove Siegel's lemma through the *adelic* Minkowski second theorem
(Theorem 2.9.13, from Appendix C.2.11), over `∏_v K_v` with normalized Haar measures. **This
roadmap pins the real route instead**: restriction of scalars along `mixedEmbedding` reduces to a
`ZLattice` in `ℝ^{dN}`, where 4.2 applies, 4.3 supplies the discriminant, 4.4 returns to `K`, and
4.5 supplies the archimedean volume. The constants close exactly: with `k = N − M`, the `2^{dk}`
of 4.2, the `2^{−r₂ k}` of 4.3 and the `2^{(r₁+r₂) k}` of 4.5's slice bounds — taking the
inscribed-cube reduction at complex places — cancel, which is the acceptance check that the
normalizations agree, and it is the check to run first, since a spare factor there means a
normalization is wrong upstream. Taking 4.5's product-of-balls bound directly instead replaces
`2^{(r₁+r₂) k}` by `2^{r₁ k} π^{r₂ k}` and leaves `(2/π)^{k r₂ / d}`, which is Bombieri–Vaaler's own
Theorem 8 constant; 5.4 states both. Each ingredient is classical and cited at its
milestone, but the assemblies in the literature are adelic (Bombieri–Vaaler; Bombieri–Gubler
§2.9) except over `ℚ` (Aliev–Henk §6); the assembly over `ℝ^{dN}`, with 4.4 in place of the
adelic triangularization, is this roadmap's, so the milestones above — not any single reference —
are the specification. The route keeps Layer 4 free of adelic Haar measure and stands on the
`ZLattice` and mixed-embedding substrate Mathlib already provides. A
contributor who prefers the adelic route must first build adelic Haar measure on
`NumberField.AdeleRing`, a substantially larger undertaking that nothing in this roadmap is
stated against.

**4.6 A basis from the minima** (Cassels, p. 135, Lemma 8, as Bugeaud–Győry cite it). With `L` and
`B` as in 4.1, `L` has a `ℤ`-basis `b 0, …, b (n − 1)` with
`b i ∈ (max 1 ((i + 1) / 2) · λ i) • B` for every `i < n`, `λ i = successiveMinimum L B i`. Against
4.2 this loses exactly `∏ i < n, max 1 ((i + 1) / 2) = n! / 2^{n−1}`, which is the `r! / 2^{r−1}`
in 6.3's constant. ⚠ The independent vectors that realize the minima (4.1) need not be a basis of
`L`, and 4.4 does not make them one: it selects vectors independent over a field and says nothing
about the index of the lattice they span. State the general form the proof gives, and the minima
form as its corollary: for any `ℝ`-independent `a 0, …, a (n − 1)` in `L` there is a basis with
`gauge B (b j) ≤ max (gauge B (a j)) (½ ∑_{i ≤ j} gauge B (a i))`. Route, by induction on `j`, with
`V_j` the real span of `a 0, …, a (j − 1)`: the quotient `(L ∩ V_{j+1}) / (L ∩ V_j)` is torsion-free
of rank one, so a basis `b 0, …, b (j − 1)` of `L ∩ V_j` extends by one vector `b` to a basis of
`L ∩ V_{j+1}`, and `a j = c • b + w` with `c` a nonzero integer and `w ∈ L ∩ V_j`. If `|c| = 1`,
take `b j = a j`. Otherwise write `b = c⁻¹ • a j + ∑_{i<j} t_i • a i` and subtract
`∑_{i<j} round t_i • a i`, an element of `L ∩ V_j`; what remains still extends the basis, and has
gauge at most `½ gauge B (a j) + ½ ∑_{i<j} gauge B (a i)`. The corollary follows from monotonicity of
the minima and the `gauge` correspondence of 4.1. This is lattice algebra with no measure in it.

### Layer 5: Siegel's lemma and Bombieri–Vaaler (the summit)

Every statement in this layer over a number field is in the **absolute** normalization on **both**
sides, matching the literature: absolute heights of the solutions on the left, and on the right the
absolute Arakelov height of the row space, the relative `H_Ar` of Layer 3 raised to `1/d`. An
absolute left side against a relative right side is off by the power `d` and is the standard slip;
the relative forms follow from Layer 0.4 by raising both sides to the `d`-th power.

**5.1 Classical Siegel, in height form** (Bombieri–Gubler, Lemma 2.9.1; Hindry–Silverman, Lemma
D.4.1 — the statement Mathlib's file is proved against, so its bound is already ours). Restate
Mathlib's `Int.Matrix.exists_ne_zero_int_vec_norm_le` in this roadmap's vocabulary: for a nonzero
`M × N` integer matrix with `M < N`, a nonzero `x ∈ ℤᴺ` with `A x = 0` and
`max |x i| ≤ (N B)^{M/(N−M)}`, `B` a bound on the entries — proved *from* Mathlib's statement rather
than from scratch, with the sup-norm-to-height translation isolated as its own lemma. Record that
the exponent `M/(N−M)` is sharp. Bombieri–Gubler's Corollary 2.9.2 is the immediate number-field
version and belongs here.

**5.2 Bombieri–Vaaler over `ℤ`** (Bombieri–Vaaler 1983, Theorems 1 and 2). Two statements, and the
second is the one Layer 5.3 generalizes. *Theorem 1, one vector:* for an `M × N` integer matrix of
rank `M < N`, a nonzero `x ∈ ℤᴺ` with `A x = 0` and
`max n, |x n| ≤ (D⁻¹ √|det (A Aᵀ)|)^{1/(N−M)}`, where `D` is the gcd of the `M × M` minors of `A`.
*Theorem 2, a basis:* under the same hypotheses there are `N − M` linearly independent integral
solutions `x₁, …, x_{N−M}` with `∏_l max n, |x_l n| ≤ D⁻¹ √|det (A Aᵀ)|`. Note `A Aᵀ`, the `M × M`
Gram matrix of the rows — not `Aᵀ A`, which is `N × N` and singular whenever `M < N`. The invariance
over 5.1 — the bound is unchanged by `A ↦ U A` for `U ∈ GL_M(ℤ)`, since `D⁻¹ √|det (A Aᵀ)|` is an
absolute height on the Grassmannian (Bombieri–Vaaler (2.5)) — is a stated corollary, and is why the
theorem is worth its cost. `√|det (A Aᵀ)|` is the Cauchy–Binet identity of 3.4 and the slice
volume is 4.5, so this is 3.4 plus Layer 4 and nothing else — over `ℤ` the extraction 4.4 is
vacuous, `d = 1` and the minima vectors are already the basis, while 4.5 already carries
Theorem 1's constant. This assembly is written out, adele-free, in Aliev–Henk §6 (Theorems
6.2–6.3, with the `ℚ`-case of 4.3's covolume identity stated there as folklore), which is the
reference to hold the milestone against.

**5.3 Bombieri–Vaaler over a number field, Hermitian form** (Bombieri–Vaaler 1983; the inequality
Vaaler 2003 quotes as (1.3) and calls straightforward). Let `K` have degree `d`, `r₁` real and `r₂`
complex places and discriminant `D_{K/ℚ}`, let `A` be an `M × N` matrix of rank `M` over `K`, write
`k = N − M`, and let `ω_j` be the volume of the unit ball of `ℝ^j`. The solution space of `A x = 0`
has a basis `x₁, …, x_k`, contained in `𝓞_K^N`, with

```text
∏_{l=1}^{k} H_Ar(x l)  ≤  [(2^k / ω_k)^{r₁} (2^k / ω_{2k})^{r₂}]^{1/d} · |D_{K/ℚ}| ^ (k / (2 d)) · H_Ar(A),
```

absolute Arakelov heights on both sides, `H_Ar(A)` the **Arakelov height of the row space** of `A`
— the subspace height of Layer 3 in the Arakelov normalization of Layer 0, taken absolute — not the
height of the entries. Route: 3.5 identifies `H_Ar(A)` with the height of the solution space `V`,
4.3 places `V ∩ 𝓞_K^N` as a `ZLattice` of rank `d k` in the real carrier of `V`, and 4.2 with the
`ℓ²` unit balls at the archimedean places as the convex body bounds the product of all `d k`
successive minima by `2^{dk} · covol / vol (B ∩ V_ℝ)`. The real carrier is the product over the
places of `V ⊗_K K_v`, so the slice is the product of the slices at each place, and a central slice
of a euclidean ball is a ball: `ω_k` at a real place, `ω_{2k}` at a complex one, and no slicing
theorem is needed. Then 4.4 selects from vectors realizing the minima a `K`-basis, the `l`-th among
the first `d (l − 1) + 1`, whose relative Arakelov height is at most `λ_{d(l−1)+1} ^ d` — integral
coordinates make every finite local factor at most one, and membership in the dilated body bounds
the archimedean ones — so the product over the basis is bounded by the product of the minima. The
`2^{dk}` of 4.2 and the `2^{−r₂ k}` of 4.3 combine to the `2^{k (r₁ + r₂)}` displayed, and Layer
0.4's absolute normalization is applied once, at the end. This needs 4.1–4.4 and nothing else, and
is the first published number-field theorem of the layer. Since `H ≤ H_Ar` (0.2), it bounds the
sup-norm heights of the basis at the same constant.

**5.4 Bombieri–Vaaler over a number field, max-norm form — the summit** (Bombieri–Gubler, Theorem
2.9.4; Bombieri–Vaaler 1983, Theorem 8). With `K`, `A` and `k` as in 5.3, the solution space of
`A x = 0` has a basis `x₁, …, x_k`, contained in `𝓞_K^N`, with

```text
∏_{l=1}^{k} H(x l)  ≤  |D_{K/ℚ}| ^ (k / (2 d))  ·  H_Ar(A),
```

`H` the absolute multiplicative height and `H_Ar(A)` the absolute Arakelov height of the row space,
as in 5.3. This is Bombieri–Gubler's Theorem 2.9.4, the statement applications quote. The
integrality of the basis carries no extra information (Remark 2.9.5), since scaling does not change
a height; state it anyway, because it is what applications quote. State with it, as the second
theorem of the same milestone, the bound at Bombieri–Vaaler's own constant,

```text
∏_{l=1}^{k} H(x l)  ≤  (2/π)^{k r₂ / d} · |D_{K/ℚ}| ^ (k / (2 d))  ·  H_Ar(A),
```

which implies the first since `2/π < 1` and is strictly sharper whenever `K` has a complex place.
Route: as in 5.3 with the sup-norm unit balls as the convex body — cubes at the real places,
polydiscs at the complex ones — whose central slices 4.5 bounds from below, place by place: the
product-of-balls form of 4.5 gives `2^k` at a real place and `π^k` at a complex one, hence the
second bound directly, and the first follows from it, or from the cube case of 4.5 through the
inscribed cube at each complex place, which is the exact cancellation of the *Route* paragraph.
Vaaler states the dependency between 5.3 and 5.4 explicitly: (1.3) follows from the second theorem,
while the max-norm form (1.4) "is more difficult because it requires the cube-slicing inequality".
The discriminant power in the bound is not removable (Roy–Thunder 1995), and the best possible
constant, a generalized Hermite constant (Vaaler 2003), is recorded in the references and is not
the target.

**5.5 The corollaries applications actually quote.** *Non-maximal rank* (Corollary 2.9.7): for `A`
of rank `R`, a basis `x₁, …, x_{N−R}` of the kernel with
`∏ H(x l) ≤ |D_{K/ℚ}|^{(N−R)/(2d)} · H_Ar^row(A)`, by restricting to `R` independent rows. *Entry
heights* (2.9.8 and Corollary 2.9.9): bounding `H_Ar^row(A) ≤ ∏_m H_Ar(A_m)` by 3.4's Fischer
inequality and `H_Ar(A_m) ≤ √N · H(A)` gives `∏ H(x l) ≤ |D_{K/ℚ}|^{(N−R)/(2d)} (√N H(A))^R`, and in
particular a single nonzero solution with `H(x) ≤ |D_{K/ℚ}|^{1/(2d)} (√N H(A))^{R/(N−R)}`. Over `ℚ`
this replaces the `N` of the classical Siegel lemma by `√N`, which is the concrete improvement to
record as the acceptance test for the whole layer.

**5.6 The relative version** (Bombieri–Gubler, Theorem 2.9.19; the `K = ℚ` case is Hindry–Silverman,
Lemma D.4.2, "Siegel's lemma, second form", which is the shape auxiliary-function constructions
quote and the one to state first). Entries in a finite extension `F/K` of degree `r`, solutions
required in `K`: if `r M < N` there are `N − r M` `K`-linearly independent `x_l ∈ 𝓞_K^N` with
`A x_l = 0` and `∏ H(x l) ≤ |D_{K/ℚ}|^{(N−rM)/(2d)} ∏_{i=1}^{M} H_Ar(A_i)^r`, `A_i` the `i`-th row
and `H_Ar(A_i)` its absolute Arakelov height as a vector of `F^N`. This is the form transcendence
arguments use, where the auxiliary construction and the field of definition differ, and it is the
interface downstream work imports.

**5.7 The auxiliary-polynomial form.** The packaging transcendence and Diophantine-approximation
arguments actually import, and the reason 5.6 is stated in the relative form: given `r` variables, a
degree bound `D`, and `N` linear conditions on the coefficients of a polynomial over `K` — typically
that it vanish to prescribed multiplicity at prescribed algebraic points — with the coefficients of
those conditions of height at most `H`, and **fewer independent conditions than coefficients**,
produce a nonzero such polynomial satisfying all of them, with an explicit height bound. Pin the
pieces: the monomial index set is `{m : Fin r →₀ ℕ | m.degree ≤ D}`, of cardinality
`M = (D + r).choose r`; the conditions are a matrix `A : Matrix (Fin N) {m // m.degree ≤ D} K`
acting on the coefficient vector; the feasibility hypothesis is `A.rank < M` (implied by
`N < M`), and in the relative form of 5.6, coefficients in `F/K` of degree `s`, it is `s · rank < M`;
and the bound is 5.5's single-solution bound with `M` in place of `N`,
`absMulHeight (coeff P) ≤ |D_{K/ℚ}|^{1/(2d)} (√M · H(A))^{R/(M − R)}` with `R = A.rank`, and its
basis form for a family of independent such polynomials. Without the feasibility hypothesis no
nonzero solution need exist and the statement is false: one variable, `D = 0`, and the single
condition "the coefficient is zero". This is 5.5
and 5.6 applied to the coefficient space of `MvPolynomial (Fin r) K` cut out by the conditions, with
Layer 2.1 supplying the height of the resulting polynomial and Layer 2.5 the height of the condition
matrix. State it so that the count of conditions and the dimension of the coefficient space appear
separately, as Hindry–Silverman D.4 does when constructing their auxiliary polynomial: downstream
users vary those two independently and a bound that has already combined them is unusable.

### Layer 6: heights and the unit group

Mathlib proves Dirichlet's unit theorem; this layer builds the height-side dictionary around it and
the S-adic generalization it does not have.

**6.1 The logarithmic embedding as a height** (Bombieri–Gubler 1.5.12). For a unit `u` every finite
local factor is `1`, so
`logHeight₁ (u : K) = ∑ w : InfinitePlace K, max 0 (mult w * log (w u))`, the sum of the positive
parts of the **full** vector of weighted logarithms over all infinite places; and since that vector
sums to `0` by the product formula, `2 * logHeight₁ u = ∑ w, |mult w * log (w u)|`, its ℓ¹ norm.
Relate this to Mathlib's `NumberField.Units.logEmbedding`, which is that vector **with the
coordinate at the distinguished place `w₀` dropped** (its codomain is `{w // w ≠ w₀} → ℝ`): the
missing coordinate is minus the sum of the others, so
`logHeight₁ u = ∑_{w ≠ w₀} (logEmbedding u w)⁺ + (−∑_{w ≠ w₀} logEmbedding u w)⁺`, and
`‖logEmbedding u‖₁ / 2 ≤ logHeight₁ u ≤ ‖logEmbedding u‖₁`. ⚠ Neither
`logHeight₁ u = ∑_w (logEmbedding u w)⁺` nor `2 logHeight₁ u = ‖logEmbedding u‖₁` holds: both
miss `w₀`, and a unit whose only large conjugate is at `w₀` refutes them. Deduce that `logEmbedding`
has finite fibres of bounded height, so that Mathlib's `unitLattice_inter_ball_finite` and Layer 1.1
are two views of one fact.

**6.2 Units of height one.** `absMulHeight₁ (u : K) = 1 ↔ u ∈ NumberField.Units.torsion K` for a
unit `u`, from Kronecker (1.4) and `logEmbedding_ker`. This is the height-theoretic identification
of the torsion subgroup, and the statement in which Kronecker's theorem is usually applied.

**6.3 The regulator and the heights of a fundamental system.** Two statements, in the absolute
logarithmic height `h`, with `r = Units.rank K` and `d = [K : ℚ]`. *Hadamard's bound, for every
fundamental system* `ε₁, …, ε_r`, in particular Mathlib's `fundSystem`:
`regulator K ≤ (2 d)^r · ∏ h(ε_i)`. The regulator is the absolute determinant of the `r × r` matrix
of `logEmbedding`s (Mathlib's `regulator` is the covolume of `unitLattice`), each row has ℓ¹ norm at
most `2 · logHeight₁ ε_i = 2 d · h(ε_i)` by 6.1, and Hadamard's inequality bounds a determinant by
the product of the ℓ² norms of its rows, which are at most the ℓ¹ norms. *A reduced basis exists*
(Bugeaud–Győry 1996, Lemma 1, the case `S = S_∞`): there is a fundamental system with
`∏ h(ε_i) ≤ c · regulator K`, `c = (r!)² / (2^{r−1} d^r)`. Route, which is theirs and produces
exactly this constant: apply the substantial half of 4.2 to `unitLattice K`, whose covolume is
`regulator K`, with `B` the closed ℓ¹ unit ball of `{w // w ≠ w₀} → ℝ`, of volume `2^r / r!`
(Mathlib's `MeasureTheory.volume_sum_rpow_le` at `p = 1`), so that `∏ λ_i ≤ r! · regulator K`; take
the basis `b` of 4.6, which costs `r! / 2^{r−1}`, and units `ε_i` with `logEmbedding ε_i = b_i`,
a fundamental system because `logEmbedding` is injective modulo torsion (`logEmbedding_ker`); and
bound each height by 6.1, `h(ε_i) = logHeight₁ ε_i / d ≤ ‖b_i‖₁ / d`, which contributes `d^{−r}`.
⚠ The second statement is an existence statement and cannot be made
for `fundSystem` or for every fundamental system: a unimodular change of basis makes the heights
arbitrarily large at fixed regulator. Nor is it a statement with unspecified constants: for a fixed
`K`, `∃ c₁ c₂ > 0, c₁ R ≤ ∏ h(ε_i) ≤ c₂ R` is true of any positive numbers and says nothing. The
heights are logarithmic on both sides; a product of multiplicative heights against the regulator is
not a theorem. "Fundamental system" means what `closure_fundSystem_sup_torsion_eq_top` says of
`fundSystem`: `r` units generating `(𝓞 K)ˣ` modulo torsion. Hadamard's determinant inequality is
linear algebra with a sorry-free proof available (see *[Provenance](#provenance)*); the lattice input
is Mathlib's `basisUnitLattice`.

**6.4 S-integers and S-units** (Bombieri–Gubler 1.5.10). Mathlib has the objects, and this milestone
defines none: for `S : Set (IsDedekindDomain.HeightOneSpectrum (𝓞 K))`, `S.integer K` is the
subalgebra of `S`-integers and `S.unit K` the subgroup of `S`-units of `Kˣ`
(`Mathlib/RingTheory/DedekindDomain/SInteger.lean`), with `x ∈ S.unit K ↔ ∀ v ∉ S, v.valuation K x = 1`
by definition, `Set.unitEquivUnitsInteger : S.unit K ≃* (S.integer K)ˣ`, and `integer_empty`, so
that `S = ∅` recovers `𝓞 K` and its units. What this milestone owns is the height side: for
`x ∈ S.unit K`, the height of `x` is supported on `S` together with the infinite places,
`mulHeight₁ x = (∏_{w | ∞} max (w x) 1 ^ mult w) · ∏_{v ∈ S} max (|x|_v) 1` with the finite places
of `K` identified with `HeightOneSpectrum (𝓞 K)` as Mathlib's `FinitePlace` does; and the
converse, that an element whose finite absolute values outside `S` are all `1` lies in `S.unit K`.
Follow the naming of mathlib4#40791.

**6.5 The S-unit theorem** (Bombieri–Gubler, Theorem 1.5.13, where it is stated as rank `|S| − 1` in
the book's convention that `S` contains the archimedean places). For `S` finite, Mathlib's `S.unit K`
is finitely generated of rank `r₁ + r₂ − 1 + |S|`, with torsion subgroup the roots of unity of `K`.
State the rank as #40791 does, `Set.unit_finrank_numberField :
finrank ℤ (Additive (S.unit K)) = Units.rank K + Nat.card S`, under that name, and beside it the
usable form in the shape of Mathlib's `exist_unique_eq_mul_prod`: a family of `r₁ + r₂ − 1 + |S|`
`S`-units such that every `S`-unit is uniquely a root of unity times a product of their integer
powers. Route, as in
#40791: the short exact sequence `1 → 𝓞ˣ → 𝓞_Sˣ → ⊕_{v ∈ S} ℤ` whose cokernel embeds in the class
group, with Mathlib's Dirichlet theorem giving the left-hand rank. Prove the `S`-analogue of 6.1,
that the `S`-logarithmic embedding has image a full lattice, and define the `S`-regulator as its
covolume, so that `S = ∅` recovers `NumberField.Units.regulator` definitionally.

## Relationship to Mathlib's height work

`Mathlib/NumberTheory/Height/` is the substrate, not a competitor: Layers 0–3 define every object in
terms of `Height.mulHeight` and its API, so there is nothing at the foundational level for this
roadmap to duplicate. Two open Mathlib pull requests do cover named milestones above.

1. **Extension invariance (Layer 0.3) is mathlib4#41606.** Build it here now with that PR's names
   and signatures — `mulHeight₁_pow_finrank`, `mulHeight_pow_finrank`, `finrank_nsmul_logHeight₁`,
   `finrank_nsmul_logHeight`, `absMulHeight₁_eq` — and cite it in the Tau Ceti file that carries
   them. Whenever the working Mathlib dependency contains them, delete ours and import Mathlib's;
   because the names and shapes match, that is a deletion plus an import rather than a rewrite, and
   Layer 0.4 and everything downstream are unaffected.
2. **The S-unit theorem (Layer 6.5) is mathlib4#40791.** The same applies: follow its short-exact-
   sequence route, its carrier `Set (HeightOneSpectrum (𝓞 K))`, and its rank formula, and delete
   ours when Mathlib's lands. The `S`-regulator and the height characterization in 6.4 are not in
   that PR and stay here.
3. **Everything else is ours.** The Arakelov normalization, the absolute tuple height, Northcott
   with varying degree, Kronecker for the height, polynomial and matrix heights, the Plücker point
   and the subspace height with its duality, successive minima and Minkowski's second theorem with
   the extraction and cube-slicing lemmas beside them, and both forms of Siegel's lemma over a
   number field are absent from Mathlib and from the open PRs.
   Where Mathlib records a TODO covering one of them — `Height/Northcott.lean` asks for the
   projectivization instances of Layer 1.1, `Height/Basic.lean` asks for `AdmissibleAbsValues`
   instances on finite extensions, which Layer 0.3 supplies the arithmetic for — build it here and
   say in the file that Mathlib records the same gap.

Follow Mathlib's shape in all of it: the multiplicative-primary-plus-logarithmic pairing, the
`lift`-from-a-representative construction for anything projectively defined, the `Northcott`
typeclass rather than bare finiteness statements, and `positivity` extensions for every new height.

## Worked examples (acceptance criteria, keeping the definitions honest)

Each of these is a cheap check that a definition means what it should; they belong in the Tau Ceti
files as `example` s.

- `Height.mulHeight₁ (3 / 4 : ℚ) = 4`, from Mathlib's `Rat.mulHeight₁_eq_max`. A definition of the
  rational height that does not give `4` here has the numerator and denominator confused.
- `NumberField.absMulHeight₁ (√2) ^ 2 = 2`, while the relative height of `√2` over `ℚ(√2)` is `2`.
  Together these exercise Layer 0.3 and 0.4: the same number, two fields, one absolute height.
- `arakelovMulHeight ![1, 1] = √2` over `ℚ`, whereas `Height.mulHeight ![1, 1] = 1`. The two
  normalizations genuinely differ, so the `√N` in 5.5 and the `H_Ar` on the right of 5.3 and 5.4 are
  not cosmetic, and a proof that silently interchanges the two heights is wrong.
- `{x : Fin 2 → ℚ | Height.mulHeight x ≤ 1}` is infinite: it contains `c • ![1, 1]` for every
  `c ≠ 0`. A `Northcott` instance for `Height.mulHeight` on tuples is refuted here; 1.1's instances
  are for `Projectivization.mulHeight`.
- `Polynomial.mulHeight (C 2 : ℚ[X]) = 1`, not `2`, and `Polynomial.mulHeight (X - C 2) = 2`: a
  constant has height one, and the affine height `mulHeight₁ a` is the height of the linear
  polynomial with root `a`, not of the constant `a`.
- Over `ℚ(i)`, `A = ![![1, 1]]` and `B = ![![N, 0], ![N, 1]]` have `Matrix.mulHeight (A * B) = 4N²`
  against `Matrix.mulHeight A · Matrix.mulHeight B = N²`: the product bound of 2.5 needs the
  relative constant `2 ^ totalWeight K = 4`, and the absolute constant `2` is refuted. The same
  test, with `2 ^ (deg p + deg q)` against `2 ^ ((deg p + deg q) · totalWeight K)`, is the one to
  run on 2.3 over a field of degree `> 1`.
- `absMulHeight₁ ζ = 1` for `ζ` a primitive fifth root of unity, and `absMulHeight₁ x = 1` for `x`
  transcendental — the second by the junk value, not by Kronecker. A statement of 1.4 without an
  algebraicity hypothesis is refuted by the second example; this is the rejection test for that
  layer.
- `Submodule.mulHeight (span ℚ {![1, 2, 3]}) = 3`, agreeing with the projective height of
  `[1 : 2 : 3]`, and `Submodule.mulHeight (⊤ : Submodule ℚ (Fin 3 → ℚ)) = 1`.
- Non-monotonicity: in `Fin 2 → ℚ`, `Submodule.mulHeight ⊤ = 1` while
  `Submodule.mulHeight (span ℚ {![1, N]}) = N` for every `N ≥ 2`, although `![1, N], ![0, 1]` is a
  basis of `⊤`. Any statement bounding the height of a subspace, or of a basis vector, by the height
  of a space containing it is refuted here; 3.6's product bounds are what submodularity gives.
- Duality on a worked case: for `A = ![![1, 1, 1]]` over `ℚ`, the row space and `V = ker A` satisfy
  `H_Ar(rowSpace A) = √3` (Cauchy–Binet: `det (A Aᵀ) = 3`), so 3.5 forces `H_Ar(V) = √3` too. The
  basis `![1, -1, 0], ![0, 1, -1]` of `V` has `∏ H = 1`, inside the 5.4 bound
  `|D_ℚ|^{2/2} · √3 = √3` since `D_ℚ = 1`. A version of 3.5 that produced anything but `√3` on both
  sides here has the minors indexed wrongly, and one that produced `1` has confused the Arakelov
  height with the sup-norm height.
- The covolume identity (4.3) over `K = ℚ(i)`, `V = span {![1, -1]}` in `K²`: the lattice
  `ℤ[i] · (1, −1)` inside `ℂ · (1, −1)` has covolume `2`, and
  `2^{−r₂} · √|discr K| · H_Ar(V)^d = (1/2) · 2 · (√2)² = 2`. A version of 4.3 without the
  `2^{−r₂ k}` fails this by a factor of `2`, and one with the sup-norm height in place of the
  Arakelov height fails it by `(√2)^d = 2`; both errors are invisible over `ℚ`, which is why this
  check is over `ℚ(i)`.
- The covolume identity (4.3) again, over a field of class number `h > 1`: `K = ℚ(√−5)`, `h = 2`,
  `V = span {![2, 1 + √−5]}` in `K²`, for which `V ∩ (𝓞 K)²` is isomorphic to the non-principal
  ideal `(2, 1 + √−5)` and is not free. Every other check here is over a principal ideal domain and
  so cannot detect a proof that assumes a basis exists; 4.3's route does not need one, and this
  example is the regression test that the Lean proof did not quietly acquire the assumption.
- `Polynomial.mulHeight ((X - 1) * (X + 1) : ℚ[X]) = 1` while
  `mulHeight (X - 1) * mulHeight (X + 1) = 1`: Gelfond's factor `2^deg` is an upper bound that is
  far from attained, which is the point of recording the sharp Mahler-measure statement in 2.3.

## Ordering

Layer 0 first: nothing downstream can state a constant without 0.2, and 0.3 is the milestone whose
Mathlib counterpart is already in flight. Layer 1 next, and it is the natural first substantial
contribution — 1.1 discharges a Mathlib TODO, and 1.2 through 1.5 need nothing but Layer 0 and
Mathlib's Mahler measure. Layers 2 and 3 are independent of each other and both depend only on
Layers 0–1; Layer 3 is the more valuable and the more delicate, and 3.1 should be settled before
anything else in it is attempted, because every later statement is about the object it constructs.
Layer 4 touches Layers 1–3 only through 4.3, whose statement uses the subspace height of 3.2 and
whose `ℚ`-case is Cauchy–Binet (3.4); 4.1 and 4.2 are real-analytic geometry of numbers, 4.4 is
self-contained linear algebra, 4.5 is self-contained real analysis — claimable on its own — and
4.6 is lattice algebra on top of 4.1, so most of the layer can be built in parallel from the start by someone who prefers those subjects. Layer 5 needs 3 and 4 together; 5.1 needs neither and can land
early as the acceptance test for the vocabulary, and 5.2 needs only 3.4, 4.2, 4.5 and the `ℚ`-case
of 4.3.

Two consequences of the milestones as now stated are worth having in view when choosing what to
claim. **4.2 is the item on the critical path, not 4.5.** The Hermitian form 5.3 — Bombieri–Vaaler
at their own constant — needs 4.1–4.4 and no cube slicing at all, so 4.5 buys the *sup-norm*
normalization of 5.2 and 5.4 rather than the sharpness of either; a contributor who finishes 4.2,
4.3 and 4.4 can land 5.3, a published theorem, before 4.5 exists. And **the `ℚ` spine is a complete
published theorem on its own**: 4.1 → 4.2 → 4.3(`ℚ`) →
4.5 → 5.2 is Bombieri–Vaaler's Theorem 1 in basis form at the sharp constant, with a written model
proof at every step (Aliev–Henk §6 for the assembly, Bombieri–Gubler C.3 for 4.5, Cassels VIII for
4.2), and it needs neither 4.4 nor any number field. Layer 6 needs Layers 0 and 1 and, for the
reduced fundamental system of 6.3 alone, Layer 4: 4.1's attainment, the substantial half of 4.2,
and 4.6. The rest of Layer 6 is independent of Layers 2–5.

Register an intention before a substantial push; the layers above are deliberately claimable
separately.

## Long horizon (a roadmap for a roadmap, not work to attempt here)

The theory built here is the entry point to Diophantine approximation on subspaces: the Schmidt
subspace theorem, Roth's theorem, unit equations and their finiteness, and the Faltings–Wüstholz
machinery. Each needs the subspace height of Layer 3 and the auxiliary-polynomial construction of
Layer 5.7 as *inputs*, and each is a roadmap in its own right, several times the size of this one.
**Do not attempt them under this roadmap**; they are recorded here to say what this material is for
and where the next roadmap should start, not as work in scope.

## Provenance

Secondary to everything above: the milestones are the specification, and the files here are cited
sources to port from, not prescriptions of shape. All are in
[`rwst/lean-code`](https://github.com/rwst/lean-code) under `ForMathlib/`, released under CC0,
sorry-free against a recent Mathlib, and written as general statements with no number theory
beyond what the milestone needs; a contributor should port and generalize rather than reprove, and
credit the source in the ported file.

- [`LinearAlgebra/LinearIndependentRestrictScalars.lean`](https://github.com/rwst/lean-code/blob/main/ForMathlib/LinearAlgebra/LinearIndependentRestrictScalars.lean)
  — 4.4 in full: `LinearIndependent.fintype_card_le_finrank_mul_finrank_span` (the counting half),
  `exists_linearIndependent_comp_of_lt_finrank_span` (greedy selection under arbitrary index
  bounds) and `LinearIndependent.exists_linearIndependent_comp_finrank_mul` (the packaged
  corollary), in the arbitrary-tower form 4.4 states.
- [`NumberTheory/HeightTuple.lean`](https://github.com/rwst/lean-code/blob/main/ForMathlib/NumberTheory/HeightTuple.lean)
  — the tuple sum bound of 2.4 (`Height.mulHeight_sum_comp_le`, with the constant
  `#s ^ totalWeight K`), the matrix product bound of 2.5 (`Matrix.mulHeight_mul_le`, with the
  `totalWeight` exponent), and the counterexample to the naive two-tuple sum bound
  (`Height.exists_not_mulHeight_add_le`).
- [`NumberTheory/HeightExtension.lean`](https://github.com/rwst/lean-code/blob/main/ForMathlib/NumberTheory/HeightExtension.lean)
  — the `K = ℚ` case of 0.3, `H_K(x) = H_ℚ(x)^{[K : ℚ]}` (`NumberField.mulHeight_ratCast`,
  `NumberField.mulHeight₁_ratCast`).
- [`Analysis/InnerProductSpace/Hadamard.lean`](https://github.com/rwst/lean-code/blob/main/ForMathlib/Analysis/InnerProductSpace/Hadamard.lean)
  — Hadamard's determinant inequality (`Matrix.norm_det_le_prod_col_norm`), the input to 6.3's
  regulator bound and to the Hadamard step in Cassels' proof of 4.2.
- [`NumberTheory/FinitePlaceProduct.lean`](https://github.com/rwst/lean-code/blob/main/ForMathlib/NumberTheory/FinitePlaceProduct.lean)
  — `∏ᶠ w : FinitePlace K, w q = (|q| ^ d)⁻¹` for `q : ℚ`, the finite part of the height of a
  rational `S`-unit, an acceptance test for 6.4.

  the product-of-balls form (Theorem C.3.8) and with a complete proof whose only import is Prékopa's
  Theorem 3. Note also Definition C.2.9: the adelic successive minima count vectors independent over
  `K`, which is why the adelic route needs no analogue of 4.4.

  The original of Layers 5.2–5.4: Theorem 1 is the one-vector bound over `ℤ` and Theorem 2 the
  basis bound, both with `D⁻¹√|det (A Aᵀ)|`; Theorem 3 is the adelic Minkowski second theorem the
  paper exists to prove; Theorem 8 is the max-norm bound over a number field at the
  `(2/π)^{k r₂ / d}` constant of 5.4. §II.1 fixes the absolute normalization `|p|_v = p^{−d_v/d}` this roadmap
  follows, defines the local heights `H_v(X)` of a matrix by the sup norm at finite places and
  `|det X Xᵀ|^{1/2}` at archimedean ones, and records that `H(X)` is intrinsic on the Grassmannian
  ((2.5)) and submultiplicative over row blocks ((2.6)). §I.3 is the discussion of why the proof
  goes through the adèles, cited in Layer 4.

  through log-concavity, whose single external input is the next entry.
- A. Prékopa, "On logarithmic concave measures and functions", *Acta Scientiarum Mathematicarum*
  **34** (1973), 335–343. Theorem 3 is Bombieri–Gubler's C.3.3 and hence the one unproved step of
  4.5; his remark reduces the two-function log-concave case — the only one needed — to the
  one-dimensional `λ = ½` inequality of A. Prékopa, "Logarithmic concave measures with application
  to stochastic programming", *ibid.* **32** (1971), 301–316. His erratum, that the sup-convolution
  is Lebesgue and not Borel measurable, is the reason 4.5 asks for the hypothesis form of the
  statement.

  of Thunder; recorded so that nobody mistakes it for the target — this roadmap asks for the
  discriminant bound of Theorem 2.9.4. Its (1.3) is the Hermitian inequality of 5.3 and its (1.4)
  the max-norm inequality of 5.4, with the remark on cube slicing quoted at 5.4.
- Y. Bugeaud and K. Győry, "Bounds for the solutions of unit equations", *Acta Arithmetica* **74**
  (1996), 67–80. Lemma 1 (§3, p. 71) is the reduced-basis statement of 6.3, stated for `S`-units:
  a fundamental system with `∏ log h(ε_i) ≤ c₄ R_S`, `c₄ = ((s−1)!)² / (2^{s−2} d^{s−1})`, where
  `s = |S|` counts the archimedean places, so that `S = S_∞` (`s − 1 = r`) is 6.3's constant. Their
  `h` is the *multiplicative* absolute height, so their `log h` is this roadmap's `h`. The proof
  (pp. 71–72) is the route 6.3 pins: Minkowski's second theorem for the ℓ¹ distance function on the
  logarithmic lattice (their (9), citing Cassels Ch. VIII), Cassels' p. 135 Lemma 8 for the basis
  (their (11); 4.6 here), and the two-sided comparison of 6.1 (their (12)). They attribute the
  lemma to L. Hajdu, "A quantitative version of Dirichlet's S-unit theorem in algebraic number
  fields", *Publ. Math. Debrecen* **42** (1993), 239–246, which extends B. Brindza, "On the
  generators of S-unit groups in algebraic number fields", *Bull. Austral. Math. Soc.* **43**
  (1991), 325–329, and reprove it with a slightly better constant than Hajdu's.

  second theorem — and the reference that milestone is held against.

  absolute height, `(Re, Im)` embedding, the `2^{−r₂}` present — and is the most convenient place to
  read the statement; his §§1–2 also fix that the subspace height there is the `ℓ²`-at-infinity one,
  i.e. Arakelov. He attributes it to Thunder, who attributes it to Schmidt 1967; his own main
  argument is adelic and is not this roadmap's route.
- J. L. Thunder, "An asymptotic estimate for heights of algebraic subspaces", *Transactions of the
  American Mathematical Society* **331** (1992), 395–424. Theorem 2 is 4.3's identity in a
  conjugate-pairs embedding and a relative height, which is why no `2^{−r₂}` appears there; he
  proves it by citation to Schmidt 1967, "the proofs being entirely similar".
- D. Roy and J. L. Thunder, "A note on Siegel's lemma over number fields", *Monatshefte für
  Mathematik* **120** (1995), 307–318. Some power of the discriminant must appear in 5.4's bound,

- W. M. Schmidt, "On heights of algebraic subspaces and diophantine approximations", *Annals of
  Mathematics* **85** (1967), 430–472. The origin of Layer 3 **and of 4.3**: §1 defines the height of
  a subspace by its Grassmann coordinates and proves the map from `d`-dimensional subspaces to lines
  in `K^N` is injective (3.1); equations (2) and (4) are the duality theorem (3.5); §2 Lemma 1 is
  Cauchy–Binet and Lemma 2 the generalized Hadamard inequality (3.4); **§3 Theorem 1 is the covolume
  identity of 4.3**, in this roadmap's normalization, with Lemmas 4–6 the two-sided proof 4.3 routes
  through. Schmidt's default height is the Euclidean one, as Bombieri–Vaaler's and
  Bombieri–Gubler's are.
