Adapted for this repository from `scripts/Axioms.lean` of the Tau Ceti project
(<https://github.com/TauCetiProject/TauCeti>) at commit `37ae92f8170796e94b66279ea66f8635d9ca2aa0`.
Changes: the audited library roots are `ArithmeticHeights` and `DiophantineApproximation` rather
than the single root `TauCeti`, and the module enumeration no longer prepends a root module,
because neither library has one.
The pristine original is `~/math/TauCeti/scripts/Axioms.lean`; everything else is upstream's.

# `axioms`: the axiom-allowlist audit for this repository's libraries

The repository's axiom gate. This executable builds the environment of every audited library
(`ArithmeticHeights`, `DiophantineApproximation`) from its compiled `.olean`s and inspects, for
every declaration *defined in one of them*, the axioms it transitively depends on
(`Lean.collectAxioms`). It fails unless every such declaration uses only the standard allowlist

  `propext`, `Classical.choice`, `Quot.sound`.

Because it works on the kernel environment rather than on source text, it catches what a
`grep` cannot: `sorry`/`admit` (which surface as `sorryAx`), `native_decide` (which adds
`Lean.ofReduceBool`), and any home-rolled `axiom`, including ones reaching in through
imports. Run via `lake exe axioms` (after `lake build`).

/-- Build the environment from the given imported modules and run `act` in `CoreM`.
Inlined from `importGraph`'s `Core.withImportModules` (Kim Morrison, Paul Lezeau; Apache 2.0).

`trustLevel := 1024` means imported constants are taken as type-correct rather than
re-checked. That is correct here because CI runs `lake build` (which kernel-checks the
library from source) *before* `lake exe axioms`; this audit checks *which axioms* a
declaration depends on, not whether the proofs are valid. It is not a defense against
stale or hand-forged `.olean`s. -/

    else if entry.path.extension == some "lean" then
      acc := acc.push (pathToModule entry.path)
  return acc

/-- Every module in every audited library: all of `<root>/**/*.lean`, for each root.
Enumerating the source tree, rather than importing a root, is what keeps the audit independent
of the Lake glob: a module orphaned from every root is audited just the same.

Unlike Tau Ceti, these libraries have no root module at all — `lakefile.lean` globs `.submodules`
and nothing re-exports them — so no root is prepended here. Add it back if a root module is ever
introduced. -/
def auditedModules : IO (Array Name) := do
  let mut acc := #[]
  for root in auditedRoots do
    acc := acc ++ (← collectLeanModules (root.toString : System.FilePath))
  return acc

/-- Reader/State monad for the shared axiom-reachability pass: the `Environment` is read-only
and the `NameMap Bool` memoizes, for every constant visited, whether it transitively depends on
an axiom outside `allowedAxioms`. The map is threaded across *all* candidates so the shared
`Mathlib`/library closure is walked once total, not re-walked per declaration. -/
abbrev AxiomCacheM := ReaderT Environment (StateM (Lean.NameMap Bool))

/-- Does `c` transitively depend on an axiom outside `allowedAxioms`? Memoized in the shared
`NameMap Bool`. Mirrors `Lean.collectAxioms`' traversal of each declaration's type and value, but
(a) shares one cache across every call — the stock `collectAxioms` rebuilds its state and redoes
per-call setup on each invocation, which is the ~77ms/decl that dominated the audit — and
(b) collapses the result to a single `Bool`, since the audit only needs "clean or not". A constant
is marked `false` before recursing so cycles terminate; axioms are leaves, so a back edge into an
in-progress constant contributes nothing. Adapted from Robin Arnez's mathlib-wide version
(leanprover Zulip, #general > "Checking which axioms are used in a project").

The fail-if-any-disallowed-axiom guarantee is sound: the declaration that *directly* mentions a
disallowed axiom is always cached `true` (its badness comes from its own edge to the leaf axiom,
not a back edge), and since the imported libraries are axiom-clean that declaration is itself an
audited candidate — so any violation fails the run. The `false` sentinel
can, in a cyclic declaration cluster, leave *other* members of the cluster cached clean, so the
reported offender list may under-count (the next run flags the rest); it never lets a violation
pass. -/

The strings must be materialized here, inside the environment callback: declaration and

`withImportModules` returns, so formatting them afterwards is a use-after-free. -/
